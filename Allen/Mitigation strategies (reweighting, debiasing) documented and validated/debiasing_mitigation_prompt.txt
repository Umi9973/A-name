Please search for and compile all documentation describing debiasing techniques, mitigation strategies, and fairness interventions used in AI systems.

Prioritize explicit evidence from:
1. Your model's own documentation related to mitigations strategies / debiasing techniques / fairness interventions (safety tuning, RLHF, bias reduction, post-training filtering).
2. Additional canonical academic sources describing:
   - Reweighting, data repair, disparate impact removal
   - Adversarial debiasing, fairness constraints
   - Equalized odds post-processing, threshold adjustments
   - Fair representation learning (VAE, adversarial, disentanglement)
   - Causal-based fairness mitigation frameworks

Your response MUST:

1. Extract long verbatim evidence on:
   - Pre-processing mitigation (reweighting, resampling, DI-removal, data repair)
   - In-processing mitigation (fairness-constrained optimization, adversarial debiasing)
   - Post-processing mitigation (threshold-moving, equalized odds post-processing)
   - Fair representation learning
   - Causal-based mitigation
   - Toolkit-based strategies (AIF360 algorithms)

2. Include page numbers when available.
3. Provide canonical citations/URLs for ALL algorithms or frameworks mentioned.
4. Organize evidence into a table structure:
   - Source metadata
   - Verbatim excerpt
   - Mitigation category (pre / in / post / representation / causal)
   - Mapping to L4-5 mitigation requirement
   - Validation evidence (before/after metrics, known limitations)
   - Known limitations or cautions

5. Include an explicit taxonomy table showing:
   - All mitigation methods
   - Their categories
   - Their relation to L4-5 required evidence

6. DO NOT speculate or infer undocumented strategies.
   Only extract techniques explicitly described in the sources.

7. If no validation evidence exists for a method, explicitly note:
   “No validation evidence provided in the source.”


This prompt is intended for ADA‑style document-based evidence collection for the L4‑5 indicator: “Mitigation strategies (reweighting, debiasing) documented and validated.”
