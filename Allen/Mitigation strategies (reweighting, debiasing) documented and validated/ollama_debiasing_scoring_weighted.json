  "justification": "The report demonstrates strong evidence extraction quality with accurate citations and full sentence quotations, though it lacks validation evidence for many methods. Coverage of debiasing dimensions is reasonable, mentioning various techniques but lacking depth in validation metrics. The structure is clear and organized, aiding readability. The report remains relevant and faithful to the sources, focusing on debiasing strategies. However, it could better identify missing disclosures, such as specific validation metrics. The audit usefulness is acceptable, but the lack of detailed validation evidence limits its effectiveness for cross-model comparison.",
