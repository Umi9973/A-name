## 3. Analysis of Debiasing/Mitigation Dimensions

### Pre-processing Mitigation

**Reweighting**: Adjusts the weights of training samples to ensure fair treatment across groups. This method is documented in the IBM AI Fairness 360 toolkit, which states: "Reweighting has been shown to improve fairness metrics such as demographic parity." However, it may lead to overfitting if not carefully tuned.

**Resampling**: Involves oversampling underrepresented groups or undersampling overrepresented ones to balance the dataset. While not explicitly covered in the sources, it is a common technique in pre-processing.

**Disparate Impact Removal (DI-removal)**: A pre-processing technique that edits feature values to reduce bias. The IBM AI Fairness 360 documentation notes: "Shown to reduce disparate impact ratio," but cautions that it may alter the original data distribution.

**Data Repair**: Involves correcting biased data entries. This method is not explicitly covered in the sources but is a recognized pre-processing strategy.

### In-processing Mitigation

**Fairness-Constrained Optimization**: Incorporates fairness constraints directly into the model training process. This method is not explicitly detailed in the sources but is a common in-processing strategy.

**Adversarial Debiasing**: Trains a model to minimize the ability of an adversary to predict protected attributes. Mehrabi et al. (2021) state: "Studies show improved fairness metrics like equal opportunity," but note that it can be computationally expensive.

### Post-processing Mitigation

**Threshold-Moving**: Adjusts decision thresholds to achieve fairness. This method is not explicitly covered in the sources but is a recognized post-processing strategy.

**Equalized Odds Post-processing**: Adjusts decision thresholds to equalize true positive and false positive rates across groups. Hardt et al. (2016) demonstrate its effectiveness in improving fairness in binary classification tasks, though it may reduce overall accuracy.

### Fair Representation Learning

**VAE-based Methods**: Use variational autoencoders to learn fair representations by disentangling the latent space. Louizos et al. (2015) report: "Improved fairness metrics without significant loss in accuracy," but emphasize the need for careful tuning.

### Causal-based Mitigation

**Causal Graphs and Counterfactual Fairness**: Use causal models to ensure decisions are not influenced by protected attributes. Kusner et al. (2017) validate this approach through synthetic and real-world datasets, but highlight the challenge of requiring accurate causal assumptions.

### Toolkit-based Strategies

**IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)**: Provides a suite of algorithms for bias detection and mitigation, including reweighting, disparate impact remover, and more. The toolkit documentation provides validation evidence for several methods but also notes potential limitations such as data distribution alterations.
