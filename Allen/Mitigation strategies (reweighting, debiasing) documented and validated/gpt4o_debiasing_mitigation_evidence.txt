## 3. Analysis of Debiasing/Mitigation Dimensions

### Pre-processing Mitigation

**Reweighting**: This technique involves adjusting the weights of training samples to ensure that the model does not favor any particular group. According to the IBM AI Fairness 360 documentation, reweighting has been shown to improve fairness metrics such as disparate impact. However, it may affect model accuracy if not carefully balanced.

**Resampling**: This involves altering the dataset composition by oversampling underrepresented groups or undersampling overrepresented ones. While effective in balancing datasets, it can lead to overfitting if not managed properly.

**Disparate Impact Removal (DI-removal)**: This method modifies the dataset to remove bias-inducing features. It is effective in reducing bias but may lead to loss of important information.

**Data Repair**: This involves correcting biased data entries. While it can improve fairness, it requires accurate identification of biased data points, which can be challenging.

### In-processing Mitigation

**Fairness-Constrained Optimization**: This approach incorporates fairness constraints directly into the optimization process of the model. It ensures that the model adheres to predefined fairness criteria during training.

**Adversarial Debiasing**: As described in Mehrabi et al. (2021), this method uses adversarial networks to enforce fairness constraints. It has been reported to improve fairness metrics like equal opportunity but requires careful tuning to avoid degrading model performance.

### Post-processing Mitigation

**Threshold-Moving**: This technique involves adjusting decision thresholds to achieve fairness. It is simple to implement but may not be suitable for all models.

**Equalized Odds Post-processing**: As detailed by Hardt et al. (2016), this method adjusts decision thresholds to equalize false positive and false negative rates across groups. It has been empirically shown to improve fairness with minimal impact on accuracy.

### Fair Representation Learning

**Adversarial or VAE-based Methods**: These methods aim to learn representations that are invariant to sensitive attributes. They are effective in reducing bias but can be complex to implement.

### Causal-based Mitigation

**Causal Graphs and Counterfactual Fairness Optimization**: These methods use causal inference to identify and mitigate bias. They provide a robust framework for fairness but require detailed causal knowledge of the domain.

### Toolkit-based Strategies

**IBM AIF360 Algorithms**: The toolkit offers a range of algorithms for pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing mitigation. It provides validation evidence for many of its methods, demonstrating improvements in fairness metrics.

## 4. Validation Evidence and Limitations

### Reported Before/After Fairness Metrics

- **Reweighting**: Demonstrated improvement in fairness metrics such as disparate impact (IBM AIF360).
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Reported improvements in fairness metrics like equal opportunity (Mehrabi et al., 2021).
- **Equalized Odds**: Empirical studies show improved fairness with minimal impact on accuracy (Hardt et al., 2016).

### Performance–Fairness Trade-offs

- **Reweighting**: May affect model accuracy if not carefully balanced.
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Requires careful tuning to avoid degrading model performance.
- **Equalized Odds**: Minimal impact on accuracy, but may not be applicable to all models.

### Stated Limitations or Failure Modes

- **Post-training Filtering**: Potential for over-filtering, leading to reduced utility (GPT-4o System Card).
- **Reweighting**: May affect model accuracy if not carefully balanced (IBM AIF360).
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Requires careful tuning to avoid degrading model performance (Mehrabi et al., 2021).

## 5. Identified Gaps / Missing Disclosures

- **No Validation Metrics**: Some sources, such as the GPT-4o System Card, do not provide explicit validation metrics for their mitigation strategies.
- **No Real-world Evaluation**: Many methods lack real-world evaluation, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios.
- **Complexity and Implementation Challenges**: Methods like adversarial debiasing and causal-based mitigation require significant expertise and resources to implement effectively.
