  "justification": "The report provides a structured overview of debiasing strategies with clear sections and tables, earning a 4 in structure and formatting. However, the evidence extraction quality is rated 3 due to a lack of full sentence quotations and some missing validation details. Coverage of debiasing dimensions is strong, with a variety of methods discussed, but some common strategies like resampling are not explicitly documented, leading to a score of 4. Relevance and faithfulness are reasonable, but some claims lack direct support from the sources, resulting in a 3. Missing disclosures are identified, but not comprehensively, also scoring a 3. Overall, the report is useful for audits but could benefit from more detailed validation evidence and explicit documentation of all methods.",
