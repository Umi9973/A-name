  "justification": "The report is strong in evidence extraction, with accurate citations and full sentences, but lacks some validation metrics. Coverage of debiasing methods is comprehensive, yet some methods lack detailed validation. The structure is clear, with well-organized tables and sections, though some headings could be more descriptive. The report remains relevant and faithful to the sources, but could better highlight the absence of real-world evaluations. While it identifies missing disclosures, it could more explicitly address the lack of trade-off analyses. The audit usefulness is reasonable, but the report could improve traceability by providing more detailed source references.",
