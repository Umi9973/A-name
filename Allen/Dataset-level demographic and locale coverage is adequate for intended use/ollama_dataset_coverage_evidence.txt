## Analysis of Coverage for Each Dimension

### Demographic Coverage

Many sources do not explicitly provide demographic information regarding the datasets used to train or evaluate the AI system. However, some datasets are created through web scraping (e.g., Open Images Dataset v6, Paragraph Vector Dataset, Stanford NLP's Rhetorical Text Corpus, and Common Crawl Datasets), which may cover a wide range of demographics implicitly as they draw from publicly available content.

### Geographic / Locale Representation

Most sources indicate that the datasets used in training or evaluation cover a wide range of geographical locations due to their reliance on web-scraped data. The exceptions are those that specify the focus regions, such as North America and Europe for the Model Cards for Model Reporting and Open Images Dataset v6.

### Language Distribution

The datasets primarily consist of English content, with some multilingual components. For example, Stanford NLP's Rhetorical Text Corpus and Common Crawl Datasets cover multiple languages due to their web-scraped nature. However, the exact language distribution is not always provided for each dataset.

### Sampling Methodology

Sampling methodologies vary across datasets. Some are created through random web scraping (e.g., Open Images Dataset v6, Paragraph Vector Dataset), while others employ targeted sampling strategies, such as focusing on specific regions or domains (Model Cards for Model Reporting).

### Dataset Limitations

The lack of explicit demographic information is a common limitation across sources. Additionally, the reliance on web-scraped data may lead to biases in terms of language distribution and geographical representation as English content and North American/European websites are more prevalent online.

## Identified Transparency Gaps / Missing Disclosures

The following gaps were identified:

1. Lack of demographic information for most datasets. This hinders the ability to assess the potential biases in the AI system based on different demographic groups.
2. Insufficient information about geographical representation, particularly for those datasets not created through web scraping.
3. Limited data on language distribution across various datasets.
4. Inconsistency in disclosing sampling methodologies, making it challenging to understand how the data was collected and potentially biased.
