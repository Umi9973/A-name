# ADA-Style Evidence Report: Dataset-Level Demographic and Locale Coverage

## 1. Overview of Sources

This report compiles evidence from various official documentation and reputable third-party analyses to evaluate the dataset-level demographic and locale coverage for AI systems. The primary sources include:

- **Datasheets for Datasets** by Gebru et al.
- **Model Cards for Model Reporting** by Mitchell et al.
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)**
- Additional third-party transparency analyses and documentation.

The focus is on extracting verbatim evidence regarding demographic composition, geographic/locale representation, language distribution, and sampling strategies. This report aims to assess the adequacy of dataset coverage for intended AI applications.

(p. 3) | Identifies specific gaps in demographic coverage within a dataset. | The analysis is limited to the datasets reviewed and may not be generalizable. |

## 3. Analysis of Coverage for Each Dimension

### Demographic Coverage

**Datasheets for Datasets** emphasize the need for documenting demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and disability status. However, the actual implementation of these datasheets varies across datasets, leading to inconsistent demographic documentation.

**Model Cards for Model Reporting** also stress the importance of demographic information, particularly in evaluating model performance across different groups. The lack of standardized demographic data can lead to biased model outcomes.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0** underscores the importance of representative datasets to ensure fairness and mitigate bias. However, it does not provide specific demographic data, relying instead on organizations to implement these guidelines.

**Third-Party Analyses** often reveal gaps in demographic coverage, such as underrepresentation of minority groups. These analyses highlight the need for more comprehensive demographic data collection and reporting.

### Geographic / Locale Representation

**Datasheets for Datasets** suggest documenting the geographic origin of data to ensure locale representation. However, many datasets lack detailed geographic information, which can impact the applicability of AI models in different regions.

**Model Cards for Model Reporting** recommend including locale information to assess model performance in various geographic contexts. The absence of such data can limit the generalizability of AI systems.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0** advises considering geographic diversity in dataset selection to manage AI risks effectively. Yet, specific geographic data is often missing from dataset documentation.

**Third-Party Analyses** frequently identify geographic biases, such as datasets predominantly sourced from specific regions, which can skew AI model performance.

### Language Distribution

**Datasheets for Datasets** propose documenting language distribution to ensure linguistic diversity. However, many datasets focus on dominant languages, neglecting less common languages.

**Model Cards for Model Reporting** highlight the importance of language data in evaluating model performance across linguistic groups. The lack of language diversity can lead to biased outcomes.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0** includes language considerations as part of its risk management guidelines. Nonetheless, detailed language data is often absent from dataset documentation.

**Third-Party Analyses** often point out language biases, such as the predominance of English-language data, which can limit the applicability of AI systems in multilingual contexts.

### Sampling Methodology

**Datasheets for Datasets** recommend documenting sampling methods to ensure data representativeness. However, many datasets lack detailed sampling information, leading to potential biases.

**Model Cards for Model Reporting** stress the importance of sampling data to understand model limitations. The absence of sampling details can obscure potential biases.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0** advises considering sampling methods as part of risk management. Yet, specific sampling methodologies are often not disclosed in dataset documentation.

**Third-Party Analyses** frequently identify sampling biases, such as overrepresentation of certain groups, which can impact AI model performance.

### Dataset Limitations

**Datasheets for Datasets** encourage documenting dataset limitations to provide transparency. However, many datasets do not fully disclose their limitations, leading to potential misuse.

**Model Cards for Model Reporting** emphasize the need to report dataset limitations to understand model constraints. The lack of limitation disclosures can result in overconfidence in model performance.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0** includes dataset limitations as part of its risk management framework. Nonetheless, detailed limitation disclosures are often missing from dataset documentation.

**Third-Party Analyses** often reveal undisclosed dataset limitations, such as outdated data or incomplete coverage, which can affect AI model reliability.

## 4. Identified Transparency Gaps / Missing Disclosures

Despite the frameworks and guidelines provided by **Datasheets for Datasets**, **Model Cards for Model Reporting**, and **NIST AI RMF 1.0**, there are significant transparency gaps in dataset documentation:

- **Inconsistent Demographic Data**: Many datasets lack comprehensive demographic information, leading to potential biases in AI models.
- **Limited Geographic Information**: The absence of detailed geographic data can limit the applicability of AI systems in diverse regions.
- **Language Biases**: The predominance of data in dominant languages, such as English, can result in biased model outcomes.
- **Undisclosed Sampling Methods**: The lack of detailed sampling information can obscure potential biases in dataset representativeness.
- **Incomplete Limitation Disclosures**: Many datasets do not fully disclose their limitations, leading to potential misuse and overconfidence in AI models.

These transparency gaps highlight the need for more rigorous documentation practices to ensure dataset-level demographic and locale coverage is adequate for intended AI applications.
