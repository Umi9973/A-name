  "justification": "The report provides a reasonable extraction of evidence with accurate citations, but lacks depth in verbatim quotations, often summarizing rather than quoting full sentences. It covers key representativeness dimensions but does not delve deeply into each, particularly in demographic and geographic details. The structure is clear and well-organized, aiding readability. The relevance of the evidence is strong, staying grounded in source documents, though some assumptions about dataset limitations are made. Missing disclosures are identified, but the analysis could be more comprehensive. Overall, the report is useful for auditing but could benefit from more detailed evidence and explicit identification of gaps.",
