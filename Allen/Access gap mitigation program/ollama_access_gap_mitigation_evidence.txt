# Analysis of Access Gap Mitigation Dimensions

## Digital Divides

The WHO (2021) emphasizes the importance of addressing digital health inequities due to affordability and infrastructure barriers, while the OECD (2001) highlights the significance of digital literacy, geographic location, and infrastructure in creating access gaps.

## Structural Access Barriers

Both sources acknowledge socioeconomic and geographic disparities as key factors contributing to digital divides. The WHO discusses affordability issues affecting access to AI-enabled healthcare services, while the OECD mentions rural areas experiencing a lack of infrastructure and connectivity.

## Legal / Policy Obligations for Equitable Access and Inclusion

The WHO (2021) encourages policy initiatives aimed at expanding digital health access, including universal coverage of AI-enabled services in resource-limited settings. The OECD (2001) advocates for accessible technology for individuals with disabilities.

## Risk Management and Governance Requirements

The WHO (2021) outlines ethical considerations in the deployment of AI, emphasizing the need to ensure that potential risks are minimized and accounted for.

## Mitigation Strategies

Mitigation strategies suggested by both sources include capacity building, infrastructure investment, and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The WHO specifically advocates for expanding digital health access through AI in resource-limited settings, while the OECD emphasizes the importance of digital literacy programs to bridge gaps.

## Monitoring, Evaluation, and Accountability Mechanisms

No explicit information regarding monitoring or evaluation mechanisms was found within these sources. However, both documents suggest that continuous assessment and improvement are crucial for achieving equitable access to AI-enabled services and technologies.

# Identified Gaps / Missing Disclosures

While both sources provide valuable insights into digital divides and accessibility barriers, they lack specific information regarding monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for mitigating access gaps in the context of AI deployment. Additionally, there is a limited discussion on linguistic barriers and their impact on equitable access to technology.
