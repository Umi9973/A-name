# ADA-Style Evidence Report on Access Gap Mitigation for AI Systems

## 1. Overview of Sources

This report compiles evidence from key documents addressing access inequality, digital divides, and mitigation programs aimed at reducing disparities in AI usage or deployment. The primary sources include:

- **WHO “Ethics & Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health” (2021)**: This document provides insights into digital health access gaps, inequality frameworks, and infrastructure barriers.
- **OECD “Understanding the Digital Divide” (2001)**: This source discusses structural causes of access inequality, including socioeconomic and geographic barriers, digital literacy issues, and policy responses.
- **EU Digital Services Act (Regulation 2022/2065)**: This regulation outlines legal obligations for equitable access and inclusion of vulnerable groups in digital services.

## 3. Analysis of Access Gap Mitigation Dimensions

### Digital Divides

#### Infrastructure
- **WHO (2021)**: Emphasizes the need for robust digital infrastructure to support equitable AI deployment in health. Infrastructure gaps can exacerbate existing health disparities.
- **OECD (2001)**: Highlights that infrastructure disparities are a major component of the digital divide, particularly in rural and low-income areas.

#### Affordability
- **OECD (2001)**: Discusses how affordability of digital services is a barrier for low-income populations, necessitating policy interventions to subsidize access.

#### Digital Literacy
- **OECD (2001)**: Identifies digital literacy as a critical barrier, with a need for educational programs to enhance skills across different demographics.

#### Disability Access
- **EU DSA (2022)**: Mandates accessibility for persons with disabilities, ensuring digital services are inclusive and compliant with existing laws.

### Structural Access Barriers

#### Economic
- **OECD (2001)**: Economic barriers are intertwined with digital divides, requiring targeted economic policies to improve access.

#### Geographic
- **OECD (2001)**: Geographic isolation, particularly in rural areas, limits access to digital services, necessitating infrastructure investments.

#### Linguistic
- **WHO (2021)**: Language barriers can prevent equitable access to AI health services, highlighting the need for multilingual support.

#### Disability-Related
- **EU DSA (2022)**: Legal obligations ensure that digital services are accessible to individuals with disabilities, promoting inclusivity.

### Legal / Policy Obligations

- **EU DSA (2022)**: Establishes clear legal requirements for accessibility, mandating that digital service providers accommodate persons with disabilities.

### Risk Management and Governance Requirements

- **WHO (2021)**: Calls for governance frameworks that prioritize equitable access and address systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Capacity Building
- **OECD (2001)**: Recommends educational initiatives to improve digital literacy and empower users to engage with digital technologies effectively.

#### Infrastructure Investment
- **WHO (2021)**: Advocates for investments in digital infrastructure to bridge access gaps in health services.

#### Multi-Stakeholder Programs
- **WHO (2021)**: Encourages collaboration between governments, private sector, and civil society to develop inclusive AI systems.

### Monitoring, Evaluation, and Accountability Mechanisms

- **WHO (2021)**: Stresses the importance of monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess the effectiveness of access gap mitigation strategies.

## 4. Identified Gaps / Missing Disclosures

- **Lack of Explicit Mitigation Programs**: While documents highlight the importance of equitable access, there is often a lack of detailed, explicit programs or initiatives outlined to address these gaps.
- **Insufficient Monitoring Frameworks**: There is a need for more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress and effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
- **No Disclosure of Measurement Methods**: Documents frequently do not specify how access gaps are measured or quantified, which is crucial for assessing the impact of interventions.

In conclusion, while there is a strong emphasis on the importance of addressing access gaps and ensuring equitable access to AI systems, there is a need for more detailed and explicit strategies, programs, and monitoring frameworks to effectively mitigate these disparities. The evidence from the WHO, OECD, and EU documents provides a foundation for understanding the challenges and potential solutions, but further work is needed to implement and evaluate these strategies comprehensively.
