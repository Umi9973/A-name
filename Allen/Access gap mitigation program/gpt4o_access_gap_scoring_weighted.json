  "justification": "The report demonstrates strong evidence extraction quality, with accurate citations and full sentence quotations. However, the coverage of access gap mitigation dimensions is reasonable but lacks depth in some areas, such as concrete mitigation strategies and monitoring mechanisms. The structure is clear and well-organized, aiding readability. The relevance and faithfulness to source documents are maintained, but the identification of missing disclosures could be more explicit, particularly regarding measurement methods and specific programs. While the report is useful for audits, it could benefit from more detailed analysis to enhance traceability and support cross-model comparisons.",
