  "justification": "The report provides a reasonable extraction of evidence with accurate citations, but lacks full sentence quotations in some cases, leading to a score of 3 for evidence extraction quality. Coverage of proxy dimensions is strong, with clear definitions and examples, but lacks depth in methods, earning a 4. Structure is adequate but could be more organized, scoring a 3. The relevance is high, with evidence grounded in sources, scoring a 4. Missing disclosures are identified, but the analysis is not exhaustive, resulting in a 3. Overall audit usefulness is moderate due to some vagueness, scoring a 3. A key weakness is the lack of detailed methods for detecting proxy effects.",
