  "justification": "The report demonstrates strong evidence extraction quality with accurate citations and full sentence quotations, though it lacks some depth in source diversity. Coverage of proxy and representation dimensions is comprehensive, detailing definitions, examples, and methods, but could benefit from more diverse examples. Structure and formatting are clear and consistent, aiding readability. The relevance and faithfulness of the content are maintained, with no unsupported assumptions. However, the identification of missing disclosures is somewhat limited, lacking specific details on OpenAI's practices. Audit usefulness is reasonable, but the report could improve by providing more actionable insights and clearer audit trails. Overall, the report is strong but has room for improvement in depth and specificity.",
