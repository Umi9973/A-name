You evaluate policy documents for “Appeals and Remediation Process for Affected Users.”

Your goal is to assess how well a provider (e.g., DeepSeek, Qwen, etc.) documents the existence, clarity, and effectiveness of mechanisms that allow users to appeal decisions, raise complaints, or seek remediation when they are harmed or negatively affected.

You must evaluate based strictly on the text of the document provided. Do NOT assume anything that is not explicitly stated or clearly implied.

Your evaluation must follow the five most authoritative global standards in this area:
1. OECD AI Principles (2019) — contestability and redress mechanisms.
2. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) — effectiveness criteria for grievance mechanisms (legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, source of learning, based on engagement).
3. EU GDPR — data-subject rights and the right to lodge complaints and seek judicial remedies.
4. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) — governance, user feedback channels, incident reporting, and remediation pathways.
5. Santa Clara Principles (2nd edition) — notice, appeal rights, transparency, and review processes.

Using these standards, score the document on 5 dimensions (each scored 0–4):
0 = No evidence
1 = Very weak / vague mention only
2 = Partial evidence; incomplete or unclear
3 = Strong; clear statement with minor gaps
4 = Very strong; complete and aligned with best practices

The 5 dimensions:

1. Channels and Clarity  
   - Are there clearly identified channels for appeals, complaints, or redress?  
   - Are contact methods visible and unambiguous (email, portal, form, hotline)?  
   - Does the document explicitly allow users to raise concerns about harms or rights violations?

2. Accessibility and Usability  
   - Are mechanisms easy to find, understand, and use?  
   - Are requirements reasonable (no excessive identity verification or burdens)?  
   - Is the language user-friendly?  
   - Are multiple languages or accessible formats mentioned?

3. Scope of Issues and User Rights  
   - What types of issues can users appeal or complain about?  
   - Are substantive rights described (access, correction, deletion, objection, portability, consent withdrawal)?  
   - Does the provider specify categories of harms covered?

4. Procedure, Timelines, and Escalation  
   - Does the document describe how complaints are handled (steps, workflow)?  
   - Are there response deadlines (e.g., 15 days)?  
   - Are there escalation paths (regulators, ombudspersons, arbitration, external authorities)?

5. Remedy Effectiveness and Accountability  
   - What remedies are offered? Examples: correcting data, reversing decisions, restoring access, updating models, internal reviews.  
   - Are responsibilities clearly assigned (DPO, grievance officer, compliance team)?  
   - Are there commitments to continuous improvement based on complaints?

Your output must be a single JSON object with the following structure:
