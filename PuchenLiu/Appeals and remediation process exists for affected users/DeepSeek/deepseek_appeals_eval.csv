deepseek_privacy_zh,"DeepSeek Privacy Policy (Chinese Version)",3,3,3,2,2,2.6,"This privacy policy provides a relatively complete framework for personal information rights and basic complaint mechanisms. It enumerates multiple data rights, provides both in-product and email contact channels, offers clear operational pathways, and commits to a 15-working-day response period. Users may request access, correction, deletion, export of data, disable permissions, opt out of data being used for model training, and delete their accounts. The policy also notes multiple times that these channels may be used for complaints and feedback. However, the mechanism primarily focuses on data-protection compliance and does not cover broader AI decision-making or content-governance appeals. It lacks detailed procedural steps, internal escalation mechanisms, and external regulatory or judicial redress pathways, and it does not provide independent oversight or systemic transparency and accountability structures. Overall, it achieves an above-average level of compliance but still falls short of international best practices."
deepseek_privacy_en,"DeepSeek Privacy Policy (EN)",3,2,3,2,2,2.4,"The DeepSeek Privacy Policy provides a reasonably clear and legally aligned framework for data subject rights and related appeals, especially for EEA/UK users, including contact channels, a broad set of privacy rights, and the ability to appeal denied requests and escalate to supervisory authorities. It also acknowledges correction/removal requests for inaccurate personal data in model outputs. However, it lacks detailed timelines, structured multi-level escalation, and explicit mechanisms for monitoring and reporting on the effectiveness of remedies. The scope is largely limited to data protection issues and does not systematically address broader AI-related harms or non-privacy human rights impacts. Overall, the policy demonstrates moderate but not best-practice alignment with OECD AI Principles, UNGPs, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, and Santa Clara Principles in terms of appeals and remediation."
deepseek_terms_en,"DeepSeek Terms of Use (EN)",3,2,2,1,1,1.8,"The DeepSeek Terms of Use provide basic channels for users to contact the provider, submit complaints about IP infringement, illegal or false information, and violations of the Terms, and raise general feedback. There are limited references to user objections in account-related contexts and a formal legal escalation path via courts in China. However, the document lacks a clearly articulated, structured appeals and remediation framework for AI-specific harms, content moderation decisions, or automated decisions. It does not define timelines, stages of review, or user rights to explanation and human review, and it offers little detail on the types of remedies available or internal accountability mechanisms. Overall, the policy meets a minimal standard for complaint channels but falls short of best practices under OECD AI Principles, UNGPs, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, and the Santa Clara Principles for transparency, procedural fairness, and effective redress."
