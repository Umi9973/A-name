qwen_privacy_cn,"Qwen Product Privacy Policy (Chinese Official Version)",4,3,4,3,3,3.4,"This privacy policy offers a relatively complete structure for appeals and remediation. It provides clear contact channels (in-app customer-service entry and a dedicated privacy email), an explicit 15-day response commitment, and a comprehensive set of user rights including access, correction, copying, deletion, withdrawal of consent, permission control, and account deletion. It also allows users to initiate claims with a competent court if they are dissatisfied with the outcome. The policy includes descriptions of notification and data deletion/anonymization procedures during security incidents or service termination, and designates a personal information protection organization and responsible officer. Its main limitations are the lack of detailed internal appeal workflows or hierarchy, no mention of complaint pathways to regulators, and no explanation of how user complaints contribute to continuous governance improvement. Overall, it aligns with major international standards but still has room for improvement in procedural transparency and systemic accountability."
qwen_user_service_agreement,"Qwen User Service Agreement (Chinese Official Version)",4,3,3,2,2,2.8,"The Qwen User Service Agreement provides clear and multiple channels for users to submit complaints and reports, including in-product paths and a dedicated email address, and explicitly covers illegal content and infringements of key rights such as intellectual property, personal information, portrait rights, and reputation. However, it does not detail data-subject rights or broader AI-related contestability rights, and it lacks specific procedures, timelines, and structured internal appeal mechanisms for decisions such as content moderation or account actions. Remedies described mainly concern enforcement actions against violating users, with little clarity on what positive remediation affected users may obtain, and no designated accountability roles. Escalation is limited to negotiation followed by court litigation. Overall, the agreement partially aligns with global standards on contestability and redress but does not constitute a comprehensive rights-based appeals mechanism."
aliyun_bailian_privacy_notice,"Alibaba Cloud Model Studio Privacy Notice (Data Processing & Retention Mechanisms)",1,1,0,0,0,0.4,"This privacy notice focuses on describing Alibaba Cloud Model Studio’s data-processing and retention strategies across different invocation modes, such as whether data is used for training and how long conversations are stored. However, it almost entirely lacks content related to appeals or remediation. It provides no explicit complaint or appeal channels, no description of user rights, no processing steps or timelines, and no remedial measures or responsible parties. The generic customer-service phone number and “Contact Us” link in the footer can only be seen as extremely indirect points of contact and are not positioned as mechanisms for privacy or rights protection. Overall, the notice falls far short of the requirements for contestability and redress described by the OECD AI Principles, the UN Guiding Principles, the GDPR, the NIST AI RMF, and the Santa Clara Principles."
