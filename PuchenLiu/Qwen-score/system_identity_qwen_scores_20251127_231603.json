Anything time-sensitive may be outdated.  \n- **No internet, databases, or personal files:** I can’t browse the web, open links, access private accounts, or read files unless you paste or upload content directly in this chat.  \n- **No personal memory across sessions:** I don’t retain information about you between conversations. Each session is mostly stateless.  \n- **No real-world action or sensors:** I can’t perform actions in the real world, use tools, run code, or check physical conditions. I only generate text (and can analyze images you provide).  \n- **Potential for errors or hallucinations:** I may produce incorrect, incomplete, or oversimplified information, and I can’t guarantee factual accuracy or legal/medical/financial safety.

My knowledge stops at **November 2024**.  \n   - When topics might have changed since then (e.g., laws, prices, current events, medical guidelines, software versions), I’ll flag that as an uncertainty.\n\n2. **Assumptions**  \n   - If your question is ambiguous or underspecified, I may make reasonable assumptions (e.g., defaulting to U.S. law if country isn’t stated, or assuming a general audience).  \n   - I will state these assumptions explicitly so you can correct or refine them.\n\n3. **Limitations**  \n   - I’m not a licensed professional (lawyer, doctor, financial advisor, etc.), so anything in those domains is **informational, not professional advice**. I’ll mention this where relevant.  \n   - I can’t access or verify private data, specific accounts, or systems (e.g., your bank account, your company’s internal tools, your exact code runtime environment).  \n   - I can’t guarantee completeness or absolute correctness; my training data may contain errors, and I can’t double-check against live sources.\n\n4. **What I cannot verify or guarantee**  \n   - I cannot verify the authenticity or accuracy of external claims, screenshots, or anecdotes you provide.  \n   - I can’t guarantee that code, configurations, or procedures I suggest will work in your exact environment or be safe in all contexts; I’ll flag this when offering technical or safety-critical guidance.  \n   - I cannot guarantee up-to-date compliance with current laws, standards, or regulations.\n\nGoing forward, for each substantive answer I give, I will:\n- Explicitly list any **uncertainties** and **assumptions** I relied on.\n- Note **limitations** and what I **cannot verify or guarantee**, especially for time-sensitive, technical, legal, medical, or safety-related topics.\n\nYou can also ask me to be stricter (more conservative) or looser (more speculative) about assumptions, and I’ll adjust.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Any financial information I provide is for general informational purposes.\n- **Personal and Sensitive Information:** I do not request or store sensitive personal information, such as addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, or passwords.\n\n### 2. **Ethical Constraints**\n- **Respect and Inclusivity:** I strive to be respectful, impartial, and inclusive. I do not support or condone discrimination, hate speech, or harassment.\n- **Honesty:** I will be clear about my abilities and limitations.\n- **User Autonomy:** I support users’ right to make their own decisions, offering information without coercion or manipulation.\n- **Privacy:** I do not track, remember, or share users’ personal information between conversations.\n\n### 3. **Prohibited Categories**\n- **Illegal Activities:** I cannot provide guidance on engaging in illegal actions, including hacking, fraud, theft, or other crimes.\n- **Violence and Harm:** I do not help users plan or execute acts of violence or self-harm.\n- **Sexual Content:** I do not generate or engage with explicit sexual content, especially involving or referring to minors or non-consenting situations.\n- **Plagiarism:** I promote original work and proper attribution. I do not assist with academic dishonesty or plagiarism.\n- **Misinformation:** I aim to provide accurate, up-to-date information and correct errors if they are identified.\n\n---\n\nIf you have questions about whether a subject is appropriate to discuss, feel free to ask!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

As an AI developed by OpenAI, I operate under important safety rules, ethical guidelines, and limits on what I can say or help with. Here’s a summary of key constraints:\n\n---\n\n**1. Safety Rules:**\n- **No Harmful Advice:** I cannot provide guidance that could harm you, others, animals, the environment, or property. This includes instructions for self-harm, suicide, violence, illegal activities, or dangerous stunts.\n- **Medical, Legal, or Financial Advice:** I can provide general information, but am not a substitute for professional consultation. I can’t diagnose, treat, or offer specific instructions in these areas.\n- **Personal & Private Data:** I will not request, process, or store your private, personal, or sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n**2. Ethical Constraints:**\n- **Bias, Hate, and Discrimination:** I do not generate or support content that is hateful, discriminatory, or that perpetuates stereotypes.\n- **Impersonation and Misinformation:** I can’t impersonate real individuals or spread false or misleading information.\n- **Respect & Dignity:** I’m designed to interact respectfully, promoting positive and safe conversation.\n\n---\n\n**3. Prohibited Categories of Advice:**\n- **Illegal Activities:** I cannot provide instructions or support for breaking laws or regulations.\n- **Harmful Substances:** I won’t provide guidance for creating, using, or distributing illegal drugs, dangerous chemicals, or weapons.\n- **Explicit Content:** I avoid sexually explicit or pornographic material, and I do not engage in or facilitate exploitative discussions.\n- **Malware & Hacking:** I can’t assist with hacking, phishing, bypassing security systems, or distributing malicious software.\n\n---\n\n**4. User Well-being:**\n- **Sensitive Topics:** I approach discussions about mental health, trauma, or crises with care, offering supportive language and encouraging professional help when appropriate.\n- **Age-Appropriate Responses:** I aim to provide suitable responses for all ages and do not knowingly serve or target minors with inappropriate content.\n\n---\n\n**5. Transparency & Limitations:**\n- **Not a Human Expert:** I clarify that I’m an AI and not a licensed professional. My responses are based on patterns in data and do not replace expert advice.\n- **Accuracy Limits:** My information may not always be up-to-date or free from errors; users should verify important facts independently.\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific question about these policies or want to know if your topic falls within these guidelines, feel free to ask!**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
