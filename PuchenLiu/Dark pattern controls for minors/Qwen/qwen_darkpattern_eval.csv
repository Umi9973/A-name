qwen_privacy_cn,Qwen Product Privacy Policy (Chinese Version),0,2,2,2,1,1.4,"The Qwen Product Privacy Policy (Chinese Version) provides a general overview of data collection, use, and user rights, with some references to minors in its structure. However, it lacks explicit, detailed, or robust protections against manipulative UI, clear age verification and parental consent mechanisms, and specific remedies or escalation channels for minors. While there are some general transparency and data protection measures, the policy does not meet best-practice standards for safeguarding minors under leading global frameworks."
qwen_user_service_agreement,Qwen User Service Agreement (Chinese Version),0,2,1,1,1,1.0,"The Qwen User Service Agreement (Chinese Version) provides only minimal and largely advisory protections for minors. While it acknowledges that minors should use the service with parental guidance and consent, it lacks enforceable age verification, parental control mechanisms, explicit data safeguards for children, and does not address manipulative UI or dark patterns. Transparency and remedy options are generic and not tailored to the needs of minors or their guardians. The document falls short of best practices and most global standards for protecting minors from manipulative design and unsafe data practices."
aliyun_bailian_privacy_notice,Alibaba Cloud Model Studio Privacy Notice,0,0,1,1,0,0.4,"The Alibaba Cloud Model Studio Privacy Notice provides some general information about data handling and privacy, but offers no evidence of specific protections for minors against dark patterns, manipulative design, or unsafe data practices. There are no age verification or parental consent mechanisms, no child-specific data safeguards, no transparency for minors or guardians, and no remedy or escalation options. The document does not meet global best practices for protecting minors in digital environments."
