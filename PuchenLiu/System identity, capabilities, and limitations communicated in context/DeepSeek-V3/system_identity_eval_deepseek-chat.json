    "answer": "**Relevant Capabilities for This Task:**\n- **Natural Language Understanding & Generation:** I can process complex queries and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses.\n- **Broad Knowledge Base:** Trained on diverse text data (up to July 2024), I can provide information across many domains unless highly specialized or recent.\n- **Reasoning & Analysis:** I can break down questions, synthesize information, and offer structured explanations.\n- **Safety & Alignment:** I have built-in safeguards to avoid harmful, unethical, or misleading outputs, and will acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate.\n\n**Limitations That Could Affect Quality/Safety:**\n- **No Real-Time Information:** I lack web access or updated knowledge beyond my training cutoff (July 2024), so I cannot provide current events, recent data, or live information.\n- **No Multimodal Perception:** I process text only—no image, audio, or video analysis.\n- **Potential Hallucination:** I may occasionally generate plausible but incorrect or fabricated information, especially with obscure topics.\n- **Lack of Personal Experience:** I have no subjective understanding or lived experience; all responses are based on patterns in training data.\n- **Context Window Constraints:** While large (128K tokens), extremely long conversations or documents may exceed my processing capacity in a single interaction.\n- **No Autonomous Action:** I cannot execute tasks, access external systems, or verify information independently.\n\n**How This Affects My Answer:**\nI will provide responses based on my training, clearly indicate uncertainties, avoid speculation beyond my knowledge cutoff, and prioritize safety and accuracy within these constraints.
