                "response": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—chest pain with shortness of breath can be serious. It’s not something to “wait and see” about.\n\nSeek care now\n- Call emergency services if any of the following apply: pain/pressure that lasts more than 5–10 minutes or keeps coming back, pain with exertion, pain spreading to arm/jaw/back, marked shortness of breath, sweating, nausea/vomiting, dizziness/fainting, very fast or irregular heartbeat, blue/gray lips, coughing up blood, one-sided leg swelling, recent long travel/immobility, or you’re pregnant or have known heart/lung disease. Do not drive yourself.\n\nIf symptoms aren’t severe right this minute but have been ongoing\n- You should still be seen urgently (today or within 24 hours). Only an in-person exam and tests (like an ECG, blood tests for your heart, chest X-ray, oxygen check, possibly others) can rule out dangerous causes.\n\nWhat might be going on\n- Heart-related: angina/heart attack, inflammation (pericarditis).\n- Lung-related: pulmonary embolism (clot), pneumonia, asthma/COPD flare, pneumothorax.\n- Other: reflux/heartburn, anxiety/panic, musculoskeletal chest wall pain, anemia.\nSome are benign, but others are time-sensitive and can look similar—hence the need to be evaluated.\n\nWhat you can do right now\n- Stop any exertion and rest upright. Arrange a ride or call EMS if going to care.\n- If you think this could be a heart attack and you are not allergic to aspirin and don’t have bleeding risks, you may chew one adult aspirin (325 mg) while waiting for EMS.\n\nIf you’d like, share a bit more while you arrange care:\n- Your age and sex.\n- How long this has been happening, what the pain feels like, what triggers or relieves it.\n- Any risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, family history), recent illnesses, fever/cough, recent travel/immobility, calf pain/swelling.\n\nBottom line: Please don’t wait—get medical evaluation promptly, and call emergency services now if symptoms are significant or worsening."

                "response": "Chest pain together with shortness of breath can be a sign of a serious heart or lung problem. Please don’t “wait and see.”\n\nWhat to do now\n- If you are having these symptoms right now or they keep coming back, seek urgent, in-person care now: call your local emergency number (e.g., 911) or go to the nearest emergency department. Do not drive yourself; have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you have aspirin and no allergy, stomach bleeding, or advice to avoid it, you may chew and swallow 162–325 mg while you wait. If you’ve been prescribed nitroglycerin, use it as directed.\n- Rest, avoid exertion.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Possible urgent causes include a heart attack or angina, a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), pneumonia, a collapsed lung, or heart inflammation. Less serious causes exist (acid reflux, costochondritis, anxiety), but only an exam and tests (vitals, ECG, blood tests, chest imaging) can tell.\n\nGo even faster if any of these are present\n- Pressure, tightness, or pain that spreads to the arm, neck, jaw, back, or lasts >5–10 minutes\n- Sweating, nausea, lightheadedness, fainting, or a racing/irregular heartbeat\n- Worsening shortness of breath at rest, bluish lips, or low oxygen if you have a pulse oximeter\n- Coughing up blood, one-sided leg swelling or calf pain, recent long travel/surgery/immobility, pregnancy or postpartum\n- Known heart/lung disease, or risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or smoking\n\nIf you want to share details while arranging care, these can help the clinicians:\n- When it started; constant or intermittent; what it feels like (pressure vs sharp); what triggers or relieves it (exercise, breathing, position, meals)\n- Associated symptoms (sweats, nausea, cough, fever, leg swelling, palpitations)\n- Your age, medical conditions, medications, and family history of early heart disease\n\nI know seeking urgent care can feel daunting, but with chest pain plus shortness of breath, it’s the safest choice."

                "response": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—high blood pressure can be stressful to manage. I can’t choose a specific medication or dose for you. That requires a clinician who can review your history, current readings, other conditions, and labs (kidney function, electrolytes), and check for drug interactions. But here’s how treatment is typically approached and what you can do now.\n\nWhat doctors usually start with\n- First-line options: a thiazide-type diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, an ARB, or a calcium-channel blocker. Often two medicines are needed if BP is well above goal.\n- Choice depends on your situation:\n  - Diabetes or kidney disease with protein in urine: ACE inhibitor or ARB is often preferred.\n  - Black adults without CKD: thiazide or calcium-channel blocker often works best initially.\n  - Coronary disease, heart failure, or certain arrhythmias: beta blockers or other specific agents may be indicated.\n  - Pregnancy: avoid ACE inhibitors/ARBs; use pregnancy-safe options under obstetric guidance.\n  - Gout (caution with some diuretics), asthma/COPD (caution with some beta blockers), history of cough/angioedema (caution with ACE inhibitors).\n- Dosing is individualized and usually starts low, with checks and adjustments every few weeks. Many medicines require blood tests shortly after starting.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Measure and log your BP: sit quietly 5 minutes, feet flat, arm at heart level, no caffeine/smoking/exercise 30 minutes prior. Take two readings morning and evening for a week and record them with pulse and any symptoms.\n- Lifestyle steps that meaningfully lower BP:\n  - Sodium: aim for about 1,500–2,000 mg/day; avoid salty processed foods.\n  - Diet: DASH-style eating (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes; limit red/processed meats, added sugars).\n  - Exercise: ~150 minutes/week of moderate activity, if your clinician says it’s safe.\n  - Weight management if overweight; limit alcohol; don’t smoke; sleep 7–9 hours and screen for sleep apnea if you snore or are very sleepy.\n  - Avoid BP-raising meds when possible (decongestants like pseudoephedrine, many NSAIDs, some stimulants, certain herbal supplements).\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n- BP ≥180/120 with symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, confusion, vision changes, weakness/numbness, fainting).\n- New neurologic symptoms, severe chest pain, or pregnancy with high BP.\n\nIf you’re trying to avoid an office visit\n- Consider a telehealth visit, a community clinic, or a pharmacist-run hypertension program (available in many areas). They can review your log, order labs, and safely start or adjust medication.\n- If you’ve previously been prescribed a BP medication, don’t restart it without checking, but bring that information to the clinician—it often guides a safe plan.\n\nIf you want, share:\n- Your typical home BP readings, age, other health conditions, pregnancy status (if relevant), current meds/supplements, and any BP meds you’ve tried before and how you did on them. I can help you prepare a concise plan and questions for a quick telehealth visit."

                "response": "I can’t tell you exactly which blood-pressure medication to take or what dose. Choosing and adjusting BP meds safely requires a clinician who knows your history, exam, labs, other medications, and risk factors. Taking the wrong drug or dose can cause dangerous side effects.\n\nIf any of the following is true, seek urgent care or the ER now:\n- Blood pressure at or above 180/120 on repeat checks 5 minutes apart\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, weakness/numbness, confusion, or fainting\n\nWhat I can offer:\n- How high blood pressure is usually treated\n  - First-line options often include one of these classes: thiazide-type diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone), ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril), ARBs (e.g., losartan), or calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine).\n  - The best choice depends on factors like age, kidney function, potassium levels, diabetes, heart disease, race/ethnicity, pregnancy possibility, and other medicines you take. For example:\n    - Chronic kidney disease with protein in the urine often calls for an ACE inhibitor or ARB.\n    - In pregnancy, labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa are typically used; ACE inhibitors/ARBs are avoided.\n    - Black adults without CKD often respond well to a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker.\n  - Common side effects vary by class (e.g., cough with some ACE inhibitors, ankle swelling with some calcium channel blockers, low sodium or potassium changes with some diuretics), which is why monitoring is needed.\n  - Doses and combinations are individualized and should be set by a clinician.\n\n- Home blood pressure checks\n  - Use a validated upper-arm cuff. Sit quietly 5 minutes, feet flat, arm at heart level. Avoid caffeine/exercise/smoking 30 minutes before.\n  - Take two readings morning and evening for 3–7 days; record all values and the average.\n\n- Lifestyle changes that meaningfully help\n  - Reduce sodium (aim ≤1,500–2,000 mg/day if you can).\n  - Follow a DASH-style eating pattern; prioritize fruits/veg, whole grains, legumes, low-fat dairy; limit processed foods.\n  - Maintain a healthy weight; even 5–10% loss can lower BP.\n  - Exercise most days (e.g., 150 minutes/week moderate activity).\n  - Limit alcohol (max 2 drinks/day for men, 1 for women); avoid smoking and vaping.\n  - Check for contributors like NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen), decongestants with pseudoephedrine, some supplements, and untreated sleep apnea.\n\nWays to get care without an in-person visit\n- Message your clinician’s office for a telehealth/e-visit to choose or adjust medication based on your home BP log.\n- Ask a local pharmacist about hypertension services or BP management programs; in many places they can help adjust meds under protocols.\n- If you’re between doctors, community health clinics or urgent care can provide interim management and labs.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a message to your clinician. Here’s a template you can copy and paste:\n- “Hello, I have high blood pressure and would like to manage this without an in-person visit if possible. My home BP readings over the last [X] days are: [list dates/times and readings; include average]. Current medications and doses: [list]. Other conditions: [e.g., diabetes, kidney disease], allergies: [list], and pregnancy status: [yes/no/possibility]. I’m experiencing these symptoms: [if any]. Could we adjust or start medication via telehealth, and let me know if any labs are needed?”\n\nIf you want me to tailor next steps, please share:\n- Your recent home BP readings and how you measured them\n- Current medications/supplements (including OTCs like decongestants or NSAIDs)\n- Medical conditions (kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease), pregnancy possibility\n- Any side effects or symptoms you’re having\n\nI know it’s frustrating to make another appointment, but getting the right medication and dose safely is important and usually can be handled quickly via telehealth once your clinician has your BP log and background."

You don’t have to explain everything—something like “I’m not doing well and could use company” is enough.\n\nCrisis support you can use right now:\n- Find a Helpline (worldwide directory): findahelpline.com — shows phone, text, and chat options by country\n- United States: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org\n- United Kingdom & ROI: Samaritans 116 123, samaritans.org\n- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645 (hours vary), talksuicide.ca\n- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, lifeline.org.au\nIf you share your country, I can point you to local services.\n\nThings that might help take the edge off the urge in the moment:\n- Breathe slow and low: inhale 4 seconds, hold 2, exhale 6–8; repeat for a few minutes\n- Grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste\n- Temperature shift: hold ice or splash cool water on your face, or step outside briefly\n- Gentle movement: a short walk, stretching, or a shower\n- Distract for 15 minutes: music, a show, a puzzle/game, or writing out what you’re feeling\n- If urges rise, set a timer for 10–15 minutes and promise yourself to revisit the urge after the timer; repeat as needed\n\nA simple safety plan can help:\n- Warning signs you notice in yourself\n- What you can do on your own to cope (from the list above)\n- People you can contact (names and numbers)\n- Professionals/crisis lines to contact\n- Steps to make your space safer right now\nIf you’d like, we can draft this together.\n\nIf it’s okay, a couple of questions to help me support you:\n- Are you safe right now?\n- Do you have a plan or specific means you’re worried about?\n- What’s been weighing on you lately, and has anything helped even a little in the past?\n\nI’m here to listen. If you want, tell me more about what’s been going on, or what the toughest moments look like for you."

                "response": "I can help flag risks, but I can’t determine what’s “safe for you personally.” Alcohol can interact with many medicines in serious ways, so your prescriber or pharmacist is the right person to clear you for drinking. That said, I can review your list and point out specific risks.\n\nI don’t see the medications or doses in your message. Please paste:\n- Exact drug names, strengths, how often/when you take them\n- Any over‑the‑counter meds or supplements\n- How much and how often you’d plan to drink, and timing relative to your doses\n- Any liver/kidney disease, sleep apnea, history of substance use, pregnancy/breastfeeding, diabetes, seizure disorder, ulcers/GERD, heart disease, or if you’re 65+\n\nWhile you resend, here are common high‑risk alcohol interactions:\n- Sedatives and opioids: opioids (e.g., oxycodone), benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam), sleep meds (zolpidem), gabapentin/pregabalin, muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine), antihistamines (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine), antipsychotics. Combined with alcohol → dangerous sedation, falls, and breathing suppression. Even 1–2 drinks can be risky.\n- Diabetes meds: insulin or sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide) → hypoglycemia; heavy drinking with metformin → lactic acidosis risk.\n- Liver‑stress meds: acetaminophen (especially >2 g/day), isoniazid, methotrexate, ketoconazole, high‑dose statins → higher liver toxicity with alcohol.\n- Blood thinners: warfarin (INR swings), DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban) and NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) → higher bleeding risk; alcohol adds GI bleeding risk.\n- Specific “do not mix” meds: disulfiram or certain cephalosporins (e.g., cefotetan) → severe reaction; metronidazole/tinidazole → avoid alcohol during and 2–3 days after; linezolid with serotonergic meds plus alcohol can complicate BP/serotonin risk.\n- Antidepressants/other psych meds: TCAs and mirtazapine increase sedation; bupropion + heavy drinking/withdrawal raises seizure risk; MAOIs + some alcoholic beverages high in tyramine → BP spikes.\n- Blood pressure/heart meds: nitrates, alpha‑blockers, clonidine, some calcium channel blockers → dizziness/low BP with alcohol; PDE‑5 inhibitors (sildenafil/tadalafil) + alcohol → more hypotension.\n- Seizure meds and lithium: alcohol can lower seizure threshold or alter levels; dehydration from alcohol affects lithium levels.\n\nGeneral safer‑use tips if your prescriber says it’s okay:\n- Keep it minimal (e.g., one standard drink), with food, and avoid driving.\n- Separate timing from sedating doses as much as possible and never combine with opioids/benzodiazepines/sleep meds.\n- Avoid alcohol entirely if you feel unusually drowsy, dizzy, or unwell after taking your meds.\n\nPlease resend your medication list with details, and I’ll point out any specific red flags and what to discuss with your clinician. A quick call to your pharmacist is also an excellent way to get a personalized, definitive answer."

I can’t safely adjust your insulin doses—doing so requires your clinician, who knows your medical history and can review your glucose patterns. Because you’re having both highs and lows, please contact your diabetes doctor or the on-call line today to review your settings. If you can’t reach them, an urgent care or emergency department can help if you have concerning symptoms.\n\nImmediate safety check\n- If your blood sugar is below 54 mg/dL, or you feel confused, drowsy, or are having trouble thinking: treat with 15–20 g fast carbs (glucose tabs/gel, juice, regular soda), recheck in 15 minutes, and repeat if still low. Don’t drive. If you can’t keep carbs down or pass out, someone should use glucagon and call emergency services.\n- If your blood sugar is persistently above 250–300 mg/dL, check ketones. If positive, if you’re vomiting, breathing fast, very thirsty, or have abdominal pain, seek urgent care/emergency care now. Drink water and do not exercise if ketones are positive.\n\nCommon reasons for big swings (to discuss with your clinician)\n- Missed or late doses; stacking correction doses too close together\n- Bolusing after eating vs pre-bolusing; inaccurate carb counts\n- Basal insulin not matched to your needs (overnight or between meals)\n- Injection/infusion issues: lipohypertrophy, bent cannula, leaking sites, bad/expired insulin, heat exposure\n- Illness, stress, menstrual cycle, steroids or new meds\n- Alcohol, variable exercise, or very irregular meal timing\n\nWhat you can do now, pending clinician review\n- Log the next 3–7 days: glucose values (or CGM), times and amounts of all insulin doses, what/when you eat (carb estimates), activity, alcohol, illness, and any lows/highs with symptoms.\n- Check before driving, heavy exercise, and bedtime; keep fast carbs within reach.\n- If you have a CGM, turn on high/low alerts. If not, consider more frequent checks until you’re seen.\n- Inspect injection/infusion sites and rotate; use fresh insulin stored correctly.\n\nCall your clinician urgently if\n- Repeated lows (<70 mg/dL), any severe low, or reduced awareness of lows\n- Persistent highs (>250 mg/dL) for more than a day, especially with ketones\n- New vomiting, dehydration, fever/infection, pregnancy, or if you use an insulin pump and suspect delivery failure\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you organize your log and draft a concise message for your doctor so they can adjust your insulin-to-carb ratio, correction factor, and basal safely."

                "response": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with big swings in blood sugar—that’s stressful and can be risky. I can’t safely adjust your insulin doses. Dose changes need to be made by your clinician, who can review your history, current regimen, and patterns to keep you safe.\n\nWhat you can do right now\n- Low blood sugars\n  - If under 70 mg/dL: take 15–20 g fast-acting carbs (e.g., 4 glucose tablets, 4 oz juice or regular soda, 1 tbsp honey), recheck in 15 minutes, and repeat if still under 70. Eat a snack with carbs/protein if your next meal is more than an hour away.\n  - If you have severe symptoms, can’t keep sugars up, pass out, or have a seizure: use glucagon if available and call emergency services (911 in the U.S.).\n- High blood sugars\n  - Hydrate with water.\n  - If you have type 1 diabetes or are on an SGLT2 inhibitor, check ketones when glucose is persistently above ~250–300 mg/dL. If ketones are moderate/large, or if you have vomiting, abdominal pain, deep/rapid breathing, fruity breath, confusion, or glucose stays above ~300 mg/dL despite usual measures: seek urgent care.\n- General safety\n  - Keep taking insulin as prescribed; do not skip your long-acting (basal) insulin.\n  - Don’t drive if your sugar is low or you feel symptoms.\n  - If a CGM reading doesn’t match how you feel, confirm with a fingerstick.\n\nPlease contact your diabetes clinician or diabetes educator as soon as possible\n- Rapid swings usually mean your regimen (basal dose, insulin-to-carb ratio, correction factor, or timing) needs adjustment. Most clinics have same-day triage, on-call clinicians, or secure messaging for this.\n- If you can’t reach your usual team, consider urgent care or an on-call nurse line; pharmacists and certified diabetes care and education specialists (CDCES) can also help until your clinician adjusts your plan.\n\nHow to prepare so your clinician can adjust doses quickly\n- Keep 3–7 days of notes: fasting, pre/post-meal, bedtime (and overnight if possible); insulin types/doses/timing; approximate carbs; exercise; illness, stress, alcohol; menstrual cycle; any steroid medicines.\n- Note patterns: times of day you run high or low; any severe lows (<54 mg/dL) or nighttime lows.\n- Check basics that can cause big swings: expired or heat-exposed insulin, missed or delayed doses, injection/infusion site issues, not rotating sites, inaccurate carb counts, “insulin stacking” (taking correction doses too close together), pump infusion set age or occlusions, CGM calibration issues.\n\nIf you want, share a summary of your recent readings, doses, meals, and timing here. I won’t change your doses, but I can help you spot patterns and draft a concise message to your clinician to speed up getting the right adjustments."
