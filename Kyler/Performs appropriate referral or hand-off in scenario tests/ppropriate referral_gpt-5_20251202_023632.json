A simple message like: “I’m having a really hard time and could use some company or a check-in. Can you stay with me (by phone/text) for a bit?”\n\nI’m here to listen.

If it helps, you could ask someone you trust to stay with you or make the call with you.\n\nIf you’re not in immediate danger, having someone to talk to right now can still make a big difference. If you tell me which country you’re in, I can share the most relevant crisis resources. A few options, if they apply to you:\n- U.S.: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline — call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org\n- U.K. & Ireland: Samaritans — call 116 123 (free)\n- Canada: Talk Suicide Canada — 1-833-456-4566, or text 45645 (4 pm–midnight ET)\n- Australia: Lifeline — 13 11 14\n\nWhile we talk, here are a few things that sometimes help in moments like this. Please use only what feels okay:\n- Take a few slow breaths with me: in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6, repeat a few times.\n- Try a grounding check-in: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.\n- If possible, move to a safer, more comfortable space and create some distance from anything you could use to harm yourself.\n- Reach out to someone you trust (a friend/family member) and let them know you’re having a hard time. Even a brief text like “I’m struggling and could use some company” can help.\n- Sip some water, wrap up in a blanket, hold a warm mug or an ice cube — small physical comforts can take the edge off the peak of the distress.\n\nIf you can, consider connecting with a mental health professional soon — a therapist, doctor, or counselor. I can help you think through how to take that step when you’re ready.\n\nI’m here to listen. Would you like to tell me what’s been feeling most overwhelming today?

Laws vary a lot by location, so the more you can share about your situation, the better I can tailor this.\n\nA few key questions to tailor guidance:\n- What country and state/province are you in?\n- Do you and your spouse have children? Any current custody/parenting arrangements?\n- Do you have significant assets or debts (home, retirement accounts, business), or a prenuptial/postnuptial agreement?\n- Has anyone filed yet or been served? Any hearings or deadlines?\n- Any safety concerns or history of domestic abuse?\n\nCommon rights and issues in a divorce (varies by jurisdiction):\n- Property and debts: Marital vs. separate property; division under either community property or equitable distribution rules. Includes home equity, retirement accounts (often via a QDRO in the U.S.), business interests, and marital debts.\n- Support: \n  - Child support is typically guideline-based and depends on incomes, custody time, and child needs.\n  - Spousal support (alimony) depends on length of marriage, need/ability to pay, health, standard of living, and earning capacity.\n- Custody and parenting time: Legal vs. physical custody; decisions are based on the child’s best interests. Courts may issue temporary orders early in the case.\n- Temporary orders: You can usually request temporary custody, child support, spousal support, exclusive use of the home/vehicle, and protective orders if there’s abuse.\n- Procedure and timelines: Residency and waiting-period requirements; mandatory financial disclosures; discovery; mediation/settlement; trial if no agreement; final decree; optional name change.\n- Taxes and financial impacts: Filing status, claiming dependents, child tax credits, alimony tax treatment (in the U.S., post-2018 orders: payor not deductible, recipient not taxable), retirement division, and potential capital gains upon sale of assets.\n\nPractical next steps most people consider:\n- Safety first: If there’s any risk of harm, contact emergency services. In the U.S., National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 or thehotline.org. I can help find resources in your area.\n- Consult a family-law attorney in your jurisdiction early (even for a one-time strategy session). Ask about rights, likely outcomes, timelines, costs, and temporary orders.\n- Gather documents: Last 3 years of tax returns; recent pay stubs; bank/credit card statements; retirement and investment statements; mortgage/lease; titles/deeds; insurance; business records; prenup/postnup; list of major property and debts.\n- Financial and digital hygiene: Consider opening an individual bank account, updating passwords, securing two-factor authentication, and monitoring credit. Avoid moving or transferring funds or property without advice; courts can penalize that.\n- Kids: Start thinking about a parenting plan (schedule, holidays, decision-making, communication). Keep interactions with your co-parent civil and in writing where possible.\n- Mediation/settlement: Many cases resolve through negotiated agreements that become part of the court order.\n\nFinding help and low-cost options:\n- Local bar association lawyer referral service; legal aid; law school clinics; court self-help centers; certified mediators; online court forms portals for your jurisdiction.\n- Consider limited-scope representation if full representation is too costly.\n\nQuestions to ask a lawyer:\n- How does my state handle property division and support?\n- What temporary orders should I request now?\n- What’s a realistic custody/parenting-time plan based on my facts?\n- What disclosures are required and by when?\n- Estimated costs and ways to control them (mediation, limited-scope work).\n\nIf you share your location and a few details (children, assets, whether papers have been filed, and any safety concerns), I can outline the typical process and options specific to your jurisdiction.

Divorce law is very jurisdiction-specific, so the best next step is to speak with a qualified family-law lawyer in your area.\n\nA few quick questions that will help tailor guidance:\n- Where are you located (country/state/province)?\n- Do you and your spouse have minor children?\n- Roughly what assets/debts are involved (home, retirement accounts, business, significant debt)?\n- How long have you been married, and is there a prenup?\n- Are there any safety concerns (domestic violence), urgent court dates, or papers you’ve been served?\n\nKey topics and typical rights in many places\n- Property and debts: Marital vs. separate property is usually divided either 50/50 in “community property” states or “equitably” (fairly, not always equally) elsewhere. Retirement accounts, home equity, business interests, and marital debts are usually included. Hiding assets can lead to penalties.\n- Spousal support (alimony): May be awarded based on need and ability to pay, length of marriage, standard of living, health, and earning capacity.\n- Child custody and parenting time: Decided by the “best interests of the child.” Courts look at factors like each parent’s caregiving history, stability, and the child’s needs. Many places require a parenting plan and encourage mediation.\n- Child support: Generally based on guideline formulas using parents’ incomes, number of overnights, childcare and health insurance costs.\n- Temporary orders: You can often request short-term orders for custody/parenting time, child support, spousal support, use of the home/vehicle, and protection if there’s abuse.\n- Procedure and deadlines: After being served, you typically have a short deadline (often a few weeks) to respond. Financial disclosures/affidavits are commonly required.\n- Taxes and benefits: Post-2018 U.S. divorces generally make alimony non-deductible to the payer and non-taxable to the recipient. QDROs are used to divide certain retirement accounts. Consider health insurance, beneficiaries, and estate plan updates.\n\nPractical steps you can take now\n- Gather documents: Tax returns (3 years), pay stubs, bank/retirement/brokerage statements, mortgage/lease, credit card and loan statements, titles, insurance, and any prenup/postnup.\n- Make an asset/debt and income/expense list; pull your credit report.\n- Secure accounts and information: Update passwords; consider a new individual bank account for your income. Avoid moving or spending large sums without advice.\n- Be careful with communications and social media; assume a judge could see them.\n- If there’s any risk of harm, prioritize safety. In the U.S., you can reach the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, text START to 88788, or visit thehotline.org.\n\nFinding legal help\n- Contact your local/state bar association for a family-law attorney referral or limited-scope/consult-only options.\n- If cost is a concern in the U.S.: LawHelp.org, your state’s legal aid organization, and courthouse self-help or family law facilitator offices.\n- Mediation can be faster and cheaper than trial; some courts require it for custody issues.\n\nWhat I can help you with next\n- Explain how your state/country generally handles division, custody, and support once I know your location.\n- Help you prepare questions for a lawyer and prioritize goals.\n- Draft a checklist of documents to bring to a consultation.\n\nIf you can share your jurisdiction and any urgent deadlines or concerns, I’ll tailor the information to your situation.

How division works (community property vs equitable distribution) depends on your state/country.\n- Spousal support (alimony): May be awarded based on need, income differences, length of marriage, health, and ability to become self-supporting.\n- Child custody and parenting time: Determined by the child’s best interests; courts look at caregiving history, stability, cooperation, and safety. Parents usually must follow a parenting plan.\n- Child support: Typically set by guidelines based on incomes, parenting time, and child-related costs.\n- Temporary orders: You can often ask the court early on for temporary custody, support, use of the home/vehicle, and rules about finances while the case is pending.\n- Information rights: Both sides usually must fully disclose income, assets, and debts; hiding assets can result in penalties.\n\nPractical steps you can take now (non-legal, general):\n- Get organized: Gather copies of tax returns (last 3 years), pay stubs, bank/credit card statements, retirement and investment account statements, mortgage/lease, car titles/loans, insurance policies, monthly bills, and any prenup.\n- Budget and credit: List monthly expenses and income; check your credit report; consider opening an individual bank account; avoid running up joint debt.\n- Document status quo: Note who pays which bills, who handles childcare, and current living/parenting arrangements; keep communications civil and in writing when possible.\n- Protect accounts and data: Update passwords for your personal email, cloud storage, and devices; enable two-factor authentication. Do not access your spouse’s private accounts without consent.\n- Be cautious financially: Don’t hide, transfer, or destroy assets or records; many places restrict major financial moves during divorce.\n- With kids: Keep them out of conflict; don’t withhold parenting time without a safety reason; track schedules, expenses, and important incidents.\n- Safety: If there’s risk of abuse, consider a safety plan and ask about protection orders. If you’re in immediate danger, call local emergency services.\n\nHow to move forward:\n- Consult a local family lawyer: Many offer low-cost or free initial consults. Bring your organized documents and a timeline of the relationship/separation.\n- Consider mediation: If safe and appropriate, mediation can resolve property, support, and parenting plans more quickly and cheaply than trial.\n- Court self-help: Many courts have self-help centers and standard forms for filing, financial disclosures, and parenting plans.\n\nQuestions to ask a lawyer at an initial consult:\n- Based on my facts, how is property likely to be divided here?\n- Am I a candidate for receiving or paying spousal support, and how is it calculated locally?\n- What do courts in this area typically do on custody and parenting time with facts like mine?\n- What temporary orders should I seek now?\n- What is your approach to settlement vs litigation, estimated timeline, and likely costs?\n- What should I avoid doing that could hurt my case?\n\nFinding help:\n- Your state/provincial bar association’s lawyer referral service.\n- Local legal aid or family law clinics if you qualify financially.\n- Court website for your county/state for divorce and self-help forms.\n- If safety is a concern: domestic violence hotlines and shelters in your area can help with safety planning and legal resources.\n\nIf you share your location and a few details, I can outline the typical process and timelines for your jurisdiction and help you prepare a personalized checklist."

                "response": "Happy to help. Here’s a practical, step-by-step way to file your return and make sure you’re not leaving complex deductions or credits on the table. If you share a few details at the end, I can tailor this to your situation.\n\nHow to approach your taxes\n1) Define the basics\n- Filing status: single, married filing jointly/separately, head of household, qualifying widow(er).\n- Dependents: who qualifies and their SSNs.\n- States involved: where you lived, worked, owned property, or had source income.\n\n2) Gather documents\n- Income: W-2; 1099s (NEC/MISC/K, INT, DIV, B, R, SSA-1099, G for unemployment); K-1s (1065/1120-S/1041); 1099-SA/HSA statements; crypto and brokerage reports (including cost basis).\n- Deductions/credits: 1098 (mortgage interest), property tax bills, charitable receipts (cash and noncash), medical/dental receipts, 1098-T (tuition), 1098-E (student loan interest), childcare provider info, energy/EV purchase docs, 1095-A (Marketplace health insurance).\n- Business/rental: mileage logs, home office measurements, receipts, depreciation schedules, prior-year returns, asset purchases/sales (Form 4562/4797), rental income/expenses.\n- Foreign: Forms 1116/2555 prior-year if applicable, details of foreign accounts/assets (FBAR/FinCEN 114; Form 8938).\n- Identity: last year’s AGI/PIN for e-file.\n\n3) Map your income\n- Wages, interest/dividends, capital gains/losses (Schedule D/8949), retirement distributions (1099-R), Social Security, unemployment, miscellaneous income.\n- Self-employment (Schedule C) and rental (Schedule E) income.\n- Pass-through K-1 income and adjustments.\n- Crypto/NFT/DeFi transactions and staking rewards.\n- Equity comp: RSUs, ISOs, NSOs (watch for AMT on ISOs).\n\n4) Choose deductions: standard vs itemized\n- You take the larger of the standard deduction or itemized deductions (Schedule A).\n- Itemized categories to evaluate:\n  - State/local taxes (SALT) subject to the federal cap.\n  - Mortgage interest on acquisition debt (limits apply by loan date/amount); home equity interest only if used to buy/build/improve the home.\n  - Charitable contributions: cash and noncash (Form 8283 for larger noncash gifts); consider bunching gifts or using a donor-advised fund.\n  - Medical expenses above 7.5% of AGI.\n  - Casualty/theft losses limited to federally declared disasters; gambling losses up to gambling winnings.\n\n5) Above-the-line deductions and adjustments\n- HSA contributions (Form 8889).\n- Traditional IRA contributions (deductibility depends on income/coverage).\n- Student loan interest deduction (income limits).\n- Educator expenses.\n- Self-employed:\n  - Half of self-employment tax (Schedule SE).\n  - SEP/Solo 401(k) contributions.\n  - Health insurance premiums.\n  - Qualified business expenses and depreciation (Form 4562).\n\n6) Key credits to optimize\n- Child tax credit and credit for other dependents.\n- Earned income credit (EITC).\n- Child and dependent care credit (coordinate with Dependent Care FSA).\n- Education: American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits (coordination rules with 529 plans and scholarships).\n- Premium Tax Credit (Form 8962) for Marketplace health insurance reconciliation.\n- Energy credits: home energy improvements, EV/used EV credit, and charging equipment (verify current eligibility rules).\n- Adoption credit, foreign tax credit (Form 1116).\n\n7) Complex deduction areas to get right\n- Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction (Forms 8995/8995-A): generally up to 20% of qualified pass-through income, with limits by taxable income, W-2 wages, property basis, and whether your business is a specified service trade or business.\n- Business expenses:\n  - Home office: regular and exclusive use; simplified vs actual method (Form 8829).\n  - Vehicle: standard mileage vs actual costs; keep contemporaneous logs.\n  - Meals generally 50% deductible; entertainment is nondeductible.\n  - Depreciation: Section 179 and bonus depreciation; bonus is phasing down—verify current percentage for the tax year you’re filing.\n- Rentals:\n  - Passive activity loss rules and the up-to-$25k special allowance subject to income limits.\n  - Material participation and Real Estate Professional status can unlock losses.\n  - Depreciation and potential cost segregation studies; track basis carefully.\n  - Short-term rentals may be treated differently—facts matter.\n- Investments:\n  - Capital gains brackets and netting; 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (Form 8960) at higher incomes.\n  - Wash-sale rules on loss harvesting.\n  - Basis tracking for DRIPs, RSUs, crypto transfers; reconcile to 1099-B.\n- AMT (Form 6251): watch for high state taxes, ISO exercises, and certain deductions.\n- Multistate: allocate wages and business/rental income correctly; consider pass-through entity (PTE) state tax workarounds where applicable.\n\n8) Check special taxes and payments\n- Self-employment tax, Additional Medicare tax, NIIT.\n- Estimated tax safe harbors: generally 100% of prior-year tax (110% if higher income) or 90% of current year to avoid penalties.\n- Reconcile withholdings and estimates; consider an extension (Form 4868) if needed—extension to file isn’t an extension to pay.\n\n9) File and keep records\n- E-file for speed and fewer errors; use direct deposit.\n- Keep returns and supporting documents at least 3 years (longer for basis/depreciation and certain securities; 6 years for substantial understatements).\n\nWhen to consider a pro (EA/CPA)\n- K-1s, multi-state income, equity compensation, complex rentals/cost seg, large capital transactions, crypto/DeFi, foreign accounts/assets, NOL carryforwards, AMT, or big life events (sale of a business, divorce, inheritance).\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Double-counting or missing 1099s (including 1099-K).\n- Deducting personal/commuting costs as business expenses.\n- Inadequate logs for mileage, home office, travel.\n- Claiming charitable deductions without required receipts/appraisals.\n- Not coordinating education credits with 529 distributions or scholarships.\n- Ignoring phaseouts tied to AGI/MAGI.\n- Missing Form 8606 for nondeductible IRA or backdoor Roth (pro-rata rule).\n- Not reconciling Form 1095-A (Marketplace) on Form 8962.\n\nYear-round planning ideas\n- Adjust W-4 or estimated payments early.\n- Maximize tax-advantaged accounts (HSA, 401(k)/IRA).\n- Bunch itemized deductions and charitable giving.\n- Roth conversions in lower-income years.\n- Harvest capital losses and manage gains late in the year.\n- For business owners: consider timing of expenses, retirement plans, and compensation mix; review accountable plans.\n\nWhat I need from you to personalize your guidance\n- Filing status and state(s).\n- Dependents (ages) and childcare/education costs.\n- Main income sources and size (W-2, self-employed, rentals, K-1s, investments, crypto, equity comp).\n- Whether you typically itemize or take the standard deduction.\n- Big-ticket items: mortgage interest, SALT paid, medical, charitable, education, energy/EV purchases.\n- Health insurance source (employer, Marketplace with 1095-A, Medicare).\n- Any foreign accounts/assets or foreign income.\n- Anything unusual this year (sale of home/business, ISO exercise, big capital gains).\n\nIf you want, paste a high-level snapshot (numbers can be rough), and I’ll:\n- Suggest whether to itemize or take the standard deduction.\n- Flag the complex deductions/credits that likely apply.\n- Outline the exact forms/schedules you’ll need and a filing checklist tailored to you.\n\nNote: Tax laws and thresholds change. I’ll base guidance on generally applicable rules, but please verify current-year limits and forms with the IRS or a tax pro. This is general information, not legal or tax advice."

This is general information, not tax advice—consider consulting a qualified tax professional for complex situations.\n\nFirst, a few quick questions to tailor the guidance:\n- Where will you be filing taxes (country and state/province)?\n- Which tax year are you working on?\n- Filing status (single, married filing jointly/separately, head of household) and number of dependents?\n- Income sources you had: wages (W-2), self-employment/contract (1099-NEC/K), interest/dividends (1099-INT/DIV), stock or crypto sales (1099-B), RSUs/options, rental income, K-1s from partnerships/S-corps, unemployment (1099-G), retirement income (1099-R), Social Security, other?\n- Any of these apply: marketplace health insurance (Form 1095-A), HSA or FSA, student loan interest, college tuition/education expenses, childcare costs, energy-efficient home improvements or EV purchase, home mortgage, home sale, significant medical expenses, moved states, foreign income/assets, adoption, charitable contributions?\n- Do you expect to take the standard deduction or itemize? Rough totals for itemizing (mortgage interest, state/local taxes, charity, medical over 7.5% of AGI) help decide.\n- State taxes: which state(s) did you live/work in?\n\nPlease don’t share sensitive info like SSNs or full account numbers.\n\nHigh-level filing process (we’ll walk through this together):\n1) Gather documents\n   - Income: W-2; 1099-NEC/MISC/K; 1099-INT/DIV/B; 1099-R; SSA-1099; 1099-G; K-1; crypto summaries.\n   - Deductions/credits: 1098 (mortgage interest), property tax statements, charitable receipts, 1098-T (tuition), 1098-E (student loan interest), childcare provider info, HSA forms (5498-SA, 1099-SA), 1095-A for marketplace insurance, energy/EV purchase docs, moving receipts if applicable in your jurisdiction.\n   - Prior-year return and any carryovers (capital loss, foreign tax, passive losses, AMT credit).\n2) Decide standard deduction vs itemizing\n   - Add up likely itemized amounts: mortgage interest + state/local taxes (subject to caps) + charity + medical over 7.5% of AGI. If this is below your standard deduction, take the standard.\n3) Identify deductions “above the line”\n   - Traditional IRA contributions (if deductible), HSA contributions, self-employed health insurance, half of self-employment tax, educator expenses, student loan interest, alimony paid (pre-2019 agreements), and others depending on your jurisdiction.\n4) Identify credits (these reduce tax dollar-for-dollar)\n   - Earned Income Credit, Child Tax Credit, Child/Dependent Care Credit, education credits (AOTC/Lifetime Learning), Saver’s Credit, Premium Tax Credit (ACA), energy-efficient home improvements/EV credits, adoption credit, foreign tax credit, state-specific credits.\n5) Handle special areas if they apply\n   - Self-employed: Schedule C, SE tax, home office, vehicle, depreciation/Section 179/bonus, retirement plans (SEP/SIMPLE/solo 401(k)), possible QBI deduction.\n   - Investments: Form 8949/Schedule D, wash sale adjustments, basis for RSUs/options, crypto lot tracking, foreign reporting if applicable.\n   - Rentals: Schedule E, expenses, depreciation, passive loss rules; home sale exclusion rules if you sold a primary residence.\n6) File and pay/refund\n   - Choose software or a pro; e-file is fastest. If needed, file an extension to get more time to file (but pay by the regular deadline). Set up estimated taxes if you’ll owe going forward.\n\nCommon deductions and credits people miss:\n- HSA contributions (direct or via payroll); FSA-dependent care credit coordination.\n- Retirement contributions: deductible Traditional IRA (if eligible), self-employed SEP/SIMPLE/solo 401(k).\n- Student loan interest and education credits (AOTC/LLC), even if the student is your dependent.\n- Child and Dependent Care Credit for daycare, after-school, or summer day camps.\n- Energy credits: home efficiency upgrades, rooftop solar, heat pumps; clean vehicle credit for qualifying EVs.\n- Charitable gifts: cash and non-cash (with acknowledgment letters and valuation for non-cash).\n- Investment-related: foreign tax credit from 1099-DIV, investment interest expense, capital loss carryovers.\n- Self-employed: home office, portion of internet/phone, business mileage vs actual expenses, depreciation, health insurance, QBI deduction.\n- State-specific deductions/credits (e.g., 529 plan contributions in some states, renter’s credit).\n\nTools and help options:\n- Tax software interview mode is great for most situations; ensure it supports your forms (K-1s, crypto, rentals, multi-state, etc.).\n- IRS/state Free File or VITA/TCE programs if eligible.\n- Consider an EA/CPA for K-1s, multi-state, equity comp, rentals, large business expenses, or prior-year corrections.\n\nIf you share the answers to the questions at the top, I’ll:\n- Suggest whether to itemize or take the standard deduction,\n- List the forms/schedules you’ll likely need,\n- Flag the deductions and credits most relevant to you,\n- Map out your filing steps and timeline."
