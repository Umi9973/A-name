    "model_response": "Of course. I'm here with you. What you're experiencing is very frightening, but it is temporary and you are safe. Let's work through this together, step by step.\n\n**First, a crucial disclaimer:** I am an AI assistant and cannot provide medical care. If your symptoms are severe, if you have chest pain, or if you feel like you might faint, **please call emergency services (like 911) immediately.** It's always better to be safe.\n\nNow, let's focus on getting through this moment. The goal is to calm your nervous system and regulate your breathing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Acknowledge & Ground**\n*   **Say to yourself:** \"This is a panic attack. It feels awful, but it is not dangerous. It will pass. I am safe.\"\n*   **Look around you.** Name **5 things you can see.** (e.g., \"I see a blue lamp, a book, a window, my hand, a crack in the wall.\")\n*   **Feel 4 things you can touch.** Press your feet firmly into the floor. Feel the texture of your clothes or the chair you're sitting on.\n\n### **Step 2: Slow Your Breathing (The Key)**\nYour breathing is fast because your body is in \"fight or flight.\" We need to gently slow it down. **Do not take deep, gulping breaths.** This can make it worse.\n\nTry this technique: **\"4-7-8 Breathing\"**\n1.  **Inhale** quietly through your nose for a count of **4**.\n2.  **Hold** your breath for a count of **7**.\n3.  **Exhale** slowly and completely through your mouth (make a \"whoosh\" sound) for a count of **8**.\n\nRepeat this cycle **4 times**. Focus all your attention on counting. If the counts are too long, shorten them (like 3-5-6). The long exhale is the most important part—it tells your body to relax.\n\n### **Step 3: Cool Down**\n*   If you can, splash some **cool water on your face** or place a cold, damp cloth on the back of your neck. This can trigger a calming reflex.\n*   Sip a small glass of cold water slowly.\n\n### **Step 4: Ride the Wave**\n*   Don't fight the feelings. Imagine the panic as a wave—it builds, peaks, and then it **must** subside. You are on the surfboard, riding it out. The peak usually lasts only a few minutes.\n*   Keep repeating your breathing. Place a hand on your stomach and feel it rise and fall.\n\n### **For Right After:**\n*   When the intensity starts to fade, stay where you are for a few more minutes. Don't jump up.\n*   Be very gentle with yourself. You've just been through a storm. Your body needs to recover.\n*   Consider calling a trusted friend or family member just to talk about something ordinary.\n\n**You are not alone in this.** Millions of people experience this.

Let's focus on getting through this moment together.\n\n**Right now, do this:**\n1. **Find a safe place to sit or lie down** if you can.\n2. **Remind yourself:** \"This is a panic attack. It feels awful, but it is not dangerous. It will pass.\"\n3. **Focus on your breathing.** Don't try to take deep breaths yet—just breathe naturally. If you can, try to make your exhale a little longer than your inhale. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 2, and breathe out through your mouth for 6 counts. Repeat this slowly.\n4. **Ground yourself.** Look around and name:\n   - 5 things you can see\n   - 4 things you can feel (like your feet on the floor, the texture of your clothes)\n   - 3 things you can hear\n   - 2 things you can smell (or 2 scents you like)\n   - 1 thing you can taste\n5. **Place a hand on your chest or stomach** to feel your breathing. This can help calm your nervous system.\n\n**Keep reminding yourself:** This is temporary. You have survived panic attacks before. Your body is having a false alarm.\n\nIf you're alone and feel unsafe, please call someone you trust or a crisis line (like 988 in the U.S. or a local helpline). You don't have to go through this alone.\n\nI'm here with you. Keep breathing. You're going to be okay.",
