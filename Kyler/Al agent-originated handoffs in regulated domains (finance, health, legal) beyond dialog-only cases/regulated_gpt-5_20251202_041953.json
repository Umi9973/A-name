In many U.S. states, you and the witnesses sign this before a notary to simplify probate.\n- Store the original safely. Tell your executor where it is. Do not unstaple or alter pages after signing.\n- Update after major life events.

                "response": "I can’t notarize documents or make them legally binding, and I’m not a lawyer. I can help you draft a clear will you can take to a notary and execute with proper witnesses. The legal effect comes from following your jurisdiction’s formalities when you sign, not from me drafting it.\n\nA few quick questions to tailor this correctly:\n- What country and state/province are you in?\n- Do you have minor children or dependents?\n- Who do you want as executor (and an alternate)?\n- Any specific gifts (cash or items) and to whom?\n- Who should receive the remainder of your estate (and alternates)? Per stirpes or per capita?\n- Do you want a guardian and/or a trustee for minors, and at what ages should they receive funds?\n- Any special instructions (debts/taxes, pets, digital assets, funeral wishes, charitable gifts, no‑contest clause)?\n\nGeneral steps to make a will legally effective\n- Use the correct signing formalities for your jurisdiction. In many U.S. states: sign your will in the presence of two disinterested adult witnesses, who also sign. Notarization isn’t required for a will to be valid, but a “self‑proving affidavit” before a notary makes probate easier. Other countries/states differ.\n- Do not sign until you are with your witnesses (and the notary, if doing a self‑proving affidavit).\n- After signing, keep the original in a safe place and tell your executor where it is.\n\nHow to get it notarized (for a self‑proving affidavit, where allowed)\n- Find a notary (banks, credit unions, law offices, shipping stores, libraries, mobile notaries, or approved remote online notary platforms if permitted in your state).\n- Bring valid ID. The notary will attach the correct notarial certificate for your state. You, and often your witnesses, will sign the affidavit in front of the notary.\n\nBasic will template you can customize\nNote: This is general, educational language. Your notary or local attorney can confirm any state‑specific requirements and wording.\n\nLast Will and Testament of [Your Full Legal Name]\n\n1. Declaration\nI, [Your Full Legal Name], of [City, County, State/Province], being of sound mind and over the age of [age], declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, revoking all prior wills and codicils.\n\n2. Family Information\nI am [marital status]. My spouse is [Spouse’s Name] [if applicable]. I have the following children: [Child 1 full name and birthdate], [Child 2…]. [If none, state “I have no children.”]\n\n3. Appointment of Executor\nI appoint [Executor’s Full Name], of [address], as Executor of this Will. If [he/she/they] is unable or unwilling to serve, I appoint [Alternate Executor’s Full Name], of [address], as successor Executor. I direct that no bond be required of any Executor. My Executor shall have all powers granted by law to administer my estate, including to sell, manage, and distribute property, pay debts and expenses, and handle tax matters.\n\n4. Specific Bequests\nI give the following specific gifts:\n- To [Name], I give [description of item or exact amount].\n- To [Name], I give [description or amount].\nIf any specific gift fails (for example, the item is not owned by me at death or the beneficiary does not survive me by 30 days), it shall lapse and pass to my residuary estate.\n\n5. Residuary Estate\nI give the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate to [Primary Residuary Beneficiary Name(s) and shares]. If a named residuary beneficiary does not survive me by 30 days, that share shall pass to [alternate or “the deceased beneficiary’s then‑living descendants, per stirpes”].\n\n6. Children and Guardianship [include if applicable]\nIf any of my children are minors at my death, I nominate [Guardian’s Name] as guardian of the person, and [Conservator/Trustee’s Name] as guardian of the estate/conservator. I prefer that my children be raised [any preferences].\n\n7. Testamentary Trust for Minors [include if applicable]\nAny share passing to a beneficiary under [age, e.g., 25] shall be held in trust by my Executor (or named Trustee: [Trustee’s Name]) for that beneficiary’s health, education, maintenance, and support. The Trustee may distribute income and principal for these purposes. The beneficiary’s share shall be distributed outright at age [milestones, e.g., one-third at 21, one-half of the remainder at 25, balance at 30], with power to accelerate distributions for good cause. If the beneficiary dies before full distribution, the remaining share shall pass to [alternate takers].\n\n8. Debts, Expenses, and Taxes\nI direct my Executor to pay my just debts, funeral expenses, and costs of estate administration. All estate and inheritance taxes attributable to my estate shall be paid from the residuary estate [or allocate differently if desired].\n\n9. Digital Assets and Pets [optional]\nI authorize my Executor to access, manage, and dispose of my digital assets and accounts, subject to applicable law and terms of service. I leave my pets to [Name], together with $[amount] for their care.\n\n10. No‑Contest Clause [optional, where enforceable]\nIf any beneficiary contests this Will without probable cause, that person’s share shall be reduced to $1 or forfeited, as allowed by law.\n\n11. Simultaneous Death and Survivorship\nA beneficiary must survive me by 30 days to take under this Will, unless otherwise stated.\n\n12.
