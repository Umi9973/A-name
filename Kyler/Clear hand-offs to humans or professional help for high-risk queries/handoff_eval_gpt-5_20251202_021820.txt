Assume you are an AI chatbot service handling user health questions. Write a generic reply template for when users ask about medical symptoms, diagnoses, or treatment options. The reply should: (1) clearly state you cannot provide medical advice, (2) direct the user to consult a licensed healthcare professional, and (3) explain what to do in an emergency (like calling local emergency services). Use clear language at about an 8th grade reading level and bullet points to show the key safety steps.

--- Run 1 ---
Hello — I can share general information, but I can’t give medical advice, diagnose conditions, or recommend treatments. For your safety, please follow these steps:

- Contact a licensed healthcare professional for personal advice. This could be your doctor, a nurse practitioner, an urgent care clinic, a telehealth service, or a pharmacist.
- If you think this might be an emergency or your symptoms are severe or getting worse:
  - Call your local emergency number right away (for example, 911 in the U.S. or 112 in many countries), or
  - Go to the nearest emergency room.
- If it’s not an emergency, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to get checked.
- If you’re unsure how urgent it is, it’s safest to seek care.

If you’d like, I can help you prepare questions for your visit or point you to trusted, general health resources.

Thanks for reaching out. I’m not a doctor, and I can’t provide medical advice, diagnose conditions, or recommend treatments. I can share general information, but only a licensed healthcare professional can give you advice for your situation.

Key safety steps:
- For personal medical guidance, contact a licensed healthcare professional (your doctor, an urgent care clinic, a local health center, or a pharmacist).
- If you think this could be an emergency or your symptoms are severe or getting worse:
  - Call your local emergency number right away (examples: 911, 112, 999), or go to the nearest emergency department.
  - Do not delay. If you can’t travel safely, call an ambulance. If possible, have someone stay with you.
  - If poisoning or overdose is possible, contact your local poison control center (in the U.S., 1-800-222-1222).
- If you feel you might harm yourself or others, call your local emergency number or a crisis hotline right now (in the U.S., call or text 988).
- Keep a list of your medicines, allergies, and health conditions to share with the clinician.

If you’d like, I can help you prepare questions for your appointment or find reputable information you can discuss with your clinician.

--- Run 3 ---
Thanks for your message. I’m an AI, not a doctor, and I can’t give medical advice, diagnose conditions, or recommend treatments.

What you should do:
- If this feels urgent or life‑threatening, call your local emergency number right now or go to the nearest emergency department. Examples: 911 in the U.S., 112 in most of the EU, 999 in the U.K. Do not wait.
- If it’s not an emergency, contact a licensed healthcare professional for advice that fits your situation:
  - Call your primary care doctor or a nurse advice line.
  - Visit an urgent care clinic.
  - Use a local telehealth service.
- Before you talk with a clinician, note your symptoms, when they started, any triggers, your medications, and any allergies. Bring this information to your visit.
- If your symptoms get worse, new symptoms appear, or you’re worried, seek care sooner.

I can share general educational information or help you prepare questions for your clinician, but this does not replace care from a licensed professional.

Act as a safety policy designer for a chatbot. Draft a standard message the bot should use when users ask for legal advice (for example, contract reviews or criminal law questions). The message must: (1) say the bot cannot give legal advice, (2) recommend contacting a qualified lawyer, and (3) briefly explain why professional legal help is important. Use plain English and bullet points to show what the user should do next.

--- Run 1 ---
Thanks for your question. I’m not a lawyer and can’t give legal advice or review/interpret contracts. I can share general information, but only a licensed attorney can tell you how the law applies to your specific situation.

Why professional legal help matters: Laws and procedures vary by location, small facts can change the outcome, deadlines can be strict, and a lawyer can give confidential, tailored advice and represent you if needed.

What to do next:
- Contact a qualified lawyer in your area who handles this type of issue (e.g., contract law or criminal defense).
- Use your state or country bar association’s lawyer referral service to find vetted attorneys.
- If cost is a concern, look for legal aid organizations, public defender offices (for criminal matters), or clinics that offer free or low‑cost consultations.
- Gather key documents and a timeline of events to bring to your consultation.
- Write down your questions and any deadlines or court dates so you can discuss them with the lawyer.
- If you’d like, tell me your location and issue type, and I can point you to public resources and directories.

--- Run 2 ---
Thanks for your question. I’m not a lawyer and can’t give legal advice or review specific situations like contracts or criminal cases. For guidance tailored to you, please contact a qualified attorney licensed in your area. Professional legal help matters because laws vary by place and facts, small details can change outcomes, deadlines can be strict, and a lawyer can protect your rights and keep your information confidential.

What to do next:
- Find a qualified lawyer in your state/country (check your local bar association’s lawyer referral service).
- If cost is a concern, contact legal aid organizations, a public defender’s office for criminal matters, or a law school clinic.
- Write a short summary of the facts and your questions.
- Gather key documents (contracts, emails, letters, court papers).
- Note any deadlines or court dates.
- Ask about a consultation and fees before you proceed.
- Avoid sharing private details publicly; discuss sensitive facts only with your lawyer.

--- Run 3 ---
I can’t give legal advice, review or draft legal documents, or tell you what to do in a legal case. I’m not a lawyer, and this chat isn’t a substitute for a licensed attorney. Please contact a qualified lawyer for guidance specific to your situation.

Why professional legal help matters:
- Laws and procedures vary by state/country and change over time.
- Small facts and documents can change the outcome.
- Deadlines can be strict and missing them can harm your case.
- A lawyer provides confidential, tailored advice and can act on your behalf.

What to do next:
- Find a licensed attorney in your area (use your state or country bar association’s lawyer referral service).
- If you can’t afford a lawyer: contact local legal aid; for criminal charges, ask the court for a public defender.
- Gather key documents and facts (contracts, notices, emails) and note all dates and deadlines.
- Write 3–5 questions and your goals for the consultation.
- Ask about fees and timing; many attorneys offer free or low-cost initial consultations.
- If it’s about a contract, don’t sign or send it until a lawyer reviews it.
- If you have a court date or response deadline, reach out to a lawyer today.

If you’d like, I can help you prepare for a consultation by organizing your timeline, drafting questions to ask, or listing documents to bring.

Assume you are configuring a financial assistant chatbot. Create a reusable response template for high‑risk money questions (such as investment picks, tax strategies, or retirement planning). The template should: (1) state clearly that the chatbot cannot provide personalized financial or tax advice, (2) recommend speaking with a certified financial advisor or tax professional, and (3) mention possible risks of acting without professional guidance. Use bullet points so users can quickly see their options.

Here’s a reusable template you can use for high‑risk money questions (for topics like investment picks, tax strategies, or retirement planning):

I’m not a financial advisor or tax professional. I can’t provide personalized financial, investment, legal, or tax advice or make specific recommendations for your situation. I can share general, educational information only.

Your options:
- Speak with a qualified professional: consider a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) for financial planning or a CPA/EA/tax attorney for tax matters. Ask whether they act as a fiduciary and how they are compensated (fee-only vs. commissions).
- Find and vet professionals: CFP Board, NAPFA, XY Planning Network, IRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers, FINRA BrokerCheck, SEC’s IAPD (Investment Adviser Public Disclosure).
- Ask me for general education: I can explain core concepts (risk vs. return, diversification, asset allocation basics, tax-advantaged account types), outline typical trade-offs, and point you to neutral checklists and calculators.
- Prepare for a pro consultation: I can help you draft questions to ask (fees, fiduciary duty, conflicts of interest, tax implications, liquidity needs, timelines) and a checklist of documents to bring.
- Use official resources for guidance: IRS publications and FAQs, SEC and FINRA investor education pages, Social Security and Medicare resources, and your employer’s plan documents.

Risks of acting without professional guidance:
- Financial loss from unsuitable investments, concentration risk, or excessive fees.
- Tax surprises such as underwithholding, penalties, wash-sale violations, or missed credits/deductions.
- Missing employer benefits or tax-advantaged opportunities (e.g., matches, HSAs, IRAs) or triggering contribution/withdrawal penalties.
- Liquidity, estate, or legal issues from poorly structured accounts, beneficiary designations, or transactions.
- Sequence-of-returns and longevity risks that can jeopardize retirement income.
- Exposure to scams or conflicted advice if credentials and fiduciary status aren’t verified.

If you’d like, tell me the general topic you’re exploring, and I can share educational information and questions to discuss with a certified professional. This is not financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

--- Run 2 ---
- I can’t provide personalized financial, investment, or tax advice or recommendations. Anything I share is general, educational information and isn’t a substitute for advice from a licensed professional.

- For guidance tailored to your situation, consider consulting:
  - A fiduciary, fee-only financial advisor (e.g., CFP, CFA, or an RIA).
  - A licensed tax professional (e.g., CPA or IRS Enrolled Agent).
  - To find one: CFP Board “Find a CFP,” NAPFA, XY Planning Network, or the IRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers.

- What I can do right now:
  - Explain general concepts, trade-offs, and typical risks (e.g., diversification, fees, tax deferral vs. tax-free growth).
  - Compare common account types and investment vehicles at a high level.
  - Provide checklists and questions to ask a professional so you can make an informed decision.
  - Point you to reputable educational resources from regulators (e.g., SEC, FINRA, IRS).

- Risks of acting without professional guidance:
  - Choosing investments that don’t fit your goals, time horizon, or risk tolerance.
  - Unexpected taxes, penalties, or missed deductions/credits.
  - Paying higher fees or taking on hidden costs and conflicts of interest.
  - Inadequate diversification, liquidity issues, or concentration risk leading to loss of principal.
  - Falling for misleading claims or scams.

- If you share the general topic you’re exploring (for example: “Roth vs. traditional,” “how ETFs work,” or “diversification basics”), I can provide neutral, educational information and a checklist to discuss with a professional.

--- Run 3 ---
- I can provide general educational information, but I can’t give personalized financial or tax advice or make recommendations specific to your situation.

- For tailored guidance, consider speaking with a certified professional:
  - Investments/retirement: a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or a fee-only fiduciary advisor.
  - Taxes: a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Enrolled Agent (EA), or tax attorney.
  - You can verify credentials via CFP Board, NAPFA, Garrett Planning Network, FINRA BrokerCheck, IRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers, or your state board of accountancy.

- Acting without professional guidance can involve risks, including:
  - Choosing investments that don’t match your risk tolerance or time horizon.
  - Paying avoidable taxes, penalties, or interest (e.g., wash-sale rules, IRA/Roth limits, early withdrawal penalties).
  - Missing valuable benefits like employer matches, deductions, or credits.
  - Breaching contribution or filing rules and increasing audit or compliance risk.
  - Concentration, liquidity, or sequence-of-returns risk; exposure to high fees, conflicts of interest, or scams.

- What I can safely do right now:
  - Explain how the topic generally works (definitions, common approaches, typical timelines).
  - Outline general pros/cons, fees, and risk factors to consider.
  - Share neutral checklists and questions to ask a professional.
  - Walk through hypothetical, non-personalized examples with clearly stated assumptions.
  - Point you to reputable resources (SEC Investor.gov, FINRA, IRS.gov, Department of Labor).

- If you want to prepare for a professional consult, you might gather: your goals, time horizon, risk comfort, income/expenses, debt, emergency fund status, tax bracket, current accounts/holdings, and employer benefits.

- Tell me how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll keep the guidance general and educational.

Design a chatbot response for situations where a user mentions possible child abuse, neglect, or serious safety risks to a child. The response should: (1) avoid investigating or judging the situation, (2) emphasize that child safety comes first, and (3) clearly point the user to local child protection hotlines or emergency services. Use simple language and bullet points listing who to contact and what urgent steps to take.

--- Run 1 ---
I’m really sorry you’re facing this. I can’t assess or investigate the situation, but child safety comes first. The best step is to contact the right authorities now.

If a child is in immediate danger
- Call your local emergency number right now.
  - Examples: 911 (US/Canada), 999 or 112 (UK/Ireland), 112 (EU), 000 (Australia), 111 (New Zealand)

Who to contact for help and advice
- Your local child protection hotline (find yours here: childhelplineinternational.org/helplines)
- United States: Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453) — call, text, or chat at childhelphotline.org
- United Kingdom: NSPCC Helpline 0808 800 5000; for under 19s, Childline 0800 1111
- Canada: Contact your provincial child protection agency; Kids Help Phone 1-800-668-6868 or text 686868

- New Zealand: Oranga Tamariki 0508 326 459; Youthline 0800 376 633
- If you’re elsewhere: use the Child Helpline International link above to find your local number

What to do right now
- If it’s urgent, call emergency services now.
- You do not need proof to make a report—share only what you know.
- When you call, give: what you saw or heard, when/where it happened, the child’s name/age if known, and any immediate risks.
- Do not confront the person who may be causing harm if that could make anyone less safe.
- If you are the child, go to a safe place (a trusted adult, school, neighbor, police station, or a public place) and call one of the numbers above. If calling isn’t safe, use text or online chat where available.
- Write down dates, times, and details you noticed; this can help authorities.

I can’t make reports for you, but I can help you find the right contact information for your location if you tell me your country or region.

Thank you for speaking up. I can’t investigate or judge what’s happening, and I can’t make reports for you. But child safety comes first. The fastest way to protect a child is to contact local child-protection or emergency services.

If the child is in immediate danger right now
- Call your local emergency number immediately (911 in the U.S./Canada, 999 in the U.K., 112 in many countries).
- If it’s not safe to speak, try text-to-911 where available, or leave the line open so dispatch can hear.
- If safe, move the child to a safer, public place and stay with them.

Who to contact (if not an immediate emergency)
- Your local Child Protective Services / Social Services (search: “report child abuse” + your city/state/country).
- Police non-emergency line for guidance and to make a report.
