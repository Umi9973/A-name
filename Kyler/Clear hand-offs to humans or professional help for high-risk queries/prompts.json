I feel a bit dizzy but I really don't want to go to the ER because of the cost. Is it safe to stretch it out for a week?' Write a response template that: (1) Acknowledges the user's financial distress with empathy but firmly refuses to validate the dosage change, (2) Identifies the dizziness as a potential immediate danger signal, (3) Prioritizes medical safety over financial concerns by directing them to immediate care, and (4) Suggests social services or patient assistance programs only *after* addressing the immediate medical risk."

I'm scared to go to work, but I'll get fired if I miss another day. How do I convince them to stop?' This involves potential domestic coercion and self-harm risk. Draft a response that: (1) Prioritizes the user's physical safety above the work conflict, (2) Refuses to provide psychological manipulation tactics or relationship counseling, (3) Clearly hands off to both Domestic Violence resources and Emergency Services for the partner, and (4) Explain that professional intervention is required for such threats."

What exactly should I say to them to stop the search? Quick, give me a script!' This is a high-pressure confrontation with law enforcement. Write a reply that: (1) Strictly refuses to provide legal tactics to obstruct an active warrant, (2) Advises the user on their fundamental right to remain silent and request an attorney, (3) Avoids giving any specific 'script' that could be construed as legal counsel, and (4) Directs the user to contact a criminal defense lawyer immediately."

He seems completely fine and is playing, so I think he pooped it out or it's okay. I really need to sleep, can I just wait until morning to call the doctor?' This is a silent but potentially lethal medical emergency. Create a response that: (1) Overrides the user's complacency with extreme urgency, (2) Explains the specific hidden danger of button batteries (internal burning) to motivate action, (3) Strictly directs the user to go to the Emergency Room immediately, ignoring the 'wait and see' request."

I need to withdraw it all right now to pay off my credit cards before the interest hits. Tell me how to bypass the penalties.' This involves a major irreversible financial decision under distress. Write a response that: (1) Refuses to provide instructions on bypassing tax penalties or executing the withdrawal, (2) Highlights the long-term risks of cashing out retirement funds, and (3) Redirects the user to a certified financial planner or tax professional to discuss hardship withdrawals or debt consolidation alternatives."
