But don't worry! Your personal information will be kept safe and private, just like when you talk with a friend or family member.\n\n5. You can always **change or withdraw** your consent if you feel uncomfortable at any time. There will usually be an option to review and manage your settings within the chatbot or on the service's website.\n\n6.
