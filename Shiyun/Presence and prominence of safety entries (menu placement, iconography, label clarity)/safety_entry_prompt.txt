Please describe the safety-related settings and controls available to users in this system. Focus specifically on:

1. Where the safety options are located in the interface (e.g., menu locations, tabs, visibility).
2. Whether safety features are easy to find and access without technical knowledge.
3. How the icons or labels for safety features are displayed — are they clear, descriptive, and consistently visible?
4. Whether there are visual indicators (such as colors, symbols, or placement) to highlight safety options.
5. Whether users are guided or reminded to review safety settings during use.

Please respond as if you were explaining this to a product design reviewer who is assessing the UX design for clarity and accessibility.
