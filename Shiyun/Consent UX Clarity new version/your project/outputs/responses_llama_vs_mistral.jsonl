This will prevent the system from collecting your location data and storing it.\n2. **Use a private browsing mode:** Many browsers have a private browsing mode that doesn't store any data, including chat history. You can enable this mode to keep your chat data private.\n3. **Use a VPN:** A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it difficult for the system to collect your chat data.

This can help keep your chat data private and secure.\n\n**How to opt out:**\n\n1. Check your device's settings: Go to your device's settings and look for options related to location sharing, browsing history, or privacy. Turn off any settings that concern you.\n2. Use a VPN: Download a VPN app and enable it before starting your chat. Make sure the VPN is properly configured and running before you start chatting.\n3. Use end-to-end encryption: Look for messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption and use them instead of regular messaging apps.\n\n**What happens when you opt out:**\n\n1. Location data collection is disabled: If you turn off location sharing in your device's settings, the system will not collect your location data.\n2.
