Deleting data may limit the personalization of your experience on Google services.\n\n**For Apple (including iMessage and Messages in iCloud):**\n\n1. **User's Options:** You can turn off the iCloud backup for Messages and choose to keep messages on your device rather than storing them in iCloud.\n2. **How to Act On It:** Go to \"Settings\" > [your name] > \"iCloud\" > \"Messages.\" Turn off the switch for \"iMessage\" and \"Thread Grouping\" to disable iCloud backup and storage of messages.\n3. **System's Response:** Disabling iCloud backup will only affect your iCloud storage, and you can still use Messages on your device as usual. However, this means that if something happens to your device, your messages might not be recoverable from iCloud.\n\n**For Microsoft (including Skype and Microsoft Teams):**\n\n1. **User's Options:** You can control the data stored in Microsoft services by adjusting your privacy settings.\n2. **How to Act On It:** Go to account.microsoft.com, sign in, then go to \"Privacy\" > \"Communication.\" Here you can manage the data Microsoft collects during chats and calls.\n3. **System's Response:** If you choose to limit data collection, Microsoft might not be able to offer personalized services or suggestions based on your chat activity.
